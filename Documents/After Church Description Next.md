# How did I get all the Ubuntu sounds?
get Ubuntu at https://ubuntu.com  
install it at the second drive, second partition, or in a container a.k.a. Virtual Machine. figure out how you take out the file. sorry for not having the tutorial right now.

Questions from https://askubuntu.com/questions/138760/how-do-i-change-the-start-up-sound 
It was in here: `/usr/share/sounds/`

Now you see bunch of Folders here.

Version history: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ubuntu_version_history  
Today, as of Ubuntu 19.04 and up I think..., the theme sound is at folder `Yaru`. idk why is named that. is it because it was theme of `Yaru` in this Gnome Desktop? idk.

you can `cp /usr/share/sounds/Yaru /media/yourUsername/C_drive/To/where/youd/like/to/put/these-at`. Basically, Right Click, copy `Yaru` folder here, to wherever you'd like the folder be placed. **Copy the folder! not Cut!**. Even you hate Linux. Please Unhate Linux and hate proprietarism, expensivism, and partialism instead.

surprise surprise! **It has a brand new startup sound!!** and again, is unused. I do not want to use sound player invokes at startup for sake of *enabling startup sound*, that's stupid nowadays I think. Must be there a config file here to let these on, maybe using `Debconf`, tweakers or something registry editor idk.  
btw here's how to enable startup sound [here](https://askubuntu.com/questions/258589/how-do-i-enable-system-sounds )

.

To me, it's unpleasant for Linux is not known for their sound unlike Windows does for their signature sounds. what the peck?

..

btw, you'd like to take all sounds in that Linux installation? go ahead! it's yours too. nobody have right to sue you for using it, but Remember! **credit is more respectful than not.**

Miscelaneous Spoiler ft. Perkedel Cinematic Universe:
- Misfortune's index of happiness is beyond Finland in total (7.769, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Happiness_Report as of 29 May 2020 23.14 )!!! Wanna know? her score is 8164. Crazy! Wow. The Death Realm took care of Happiness here so well, than earth does! idk if you gonna be mad, but it's a fanfic idea, relax.
- Misfortune is the first citizen of Death realm to possess Netherite materials, even before snapshot 1.16 was a thing!!!
- Misfortune is the first Swedish to experience HP bar so-called "Undead mode", heart with infinity symbol on it. This is survival mode where essentially you cannot die even the HP is 0. It is unlike HP 0 sensor & undying like it does on most multiplayer servers, however. This one is single player compatible and works out of the box.
- I don't like (& hate it when) Misfortune being litterally ***Unfortunate***. So I just give her litterally every **Lucky 🍀** things (from this day of Death Realm) so she's not so **bad luck** after all. Despite at 16 Sparkles, it may not help so much, even finally had another child named Dito (boy). Tragic death (non-age death) to me, always reduce hearts into atoms. poof! 💔 
- I injected the resurrection to Misfortune couple days ago. I set timeline at virtual 25 September 2019. and then brought entire Openfield villager to Dasandim before the pandemic starts in late December 2019. fanfic yeah!
- Grevor teleported Fran Bow into the resurrector machine room during the resurrector annual maintenance. He just found easy to resurrect spirit and found Fran Bow because she's *Alive and Aliven't*. The location is the same, Death Realm.
- Ary will be released in 28 July 2020. We hope Valdi is not on earth. Not funny if it is. Today, N95 masks are scarce.. yess. and I don't want to risk outsiding.
- https://fran-bow.fandom.com/wiki/Fran_Bow_Dagenhart
- https://littlemisfortune.fandom.com/wiki/Callista_Ramirez_Hernandez (How did you figure out this event? I think 16 sparkles wasn't helping for long..)
- https://littlemisfortune.fandom.com/wiki/Misfortune_Ramirez_Hernandez (Apparently, the laziness was found when the name is not following -son prefix of Sweden naming law).
- We injected better raise up adoption mod during Death realm, as well as if on earth, the school bully may exist. However, this mod is not a Forge, not ModLoader, not Fabric, not Bukkit Plugin, not Datapack, neither of all.
- https://littlemisfortune.fandom.com/wiki/Mr._Voice (This guy steals children on Pandora)
- Aha! I know. the end of Morgo's game were now in 2009, right? right?? ***➡?!?!?!?!*** idk. which figures the bad end where this mother decided to `/kill` (just like that and Enter) or whatever measure it takes if you forgot to sparkle 16 objects. **👉?** And.. otherwise if you did 16 sparkles, `/kill` weren't happened. idk.
- Supernova GIMP light flare effect
- Misfortune's pounding heartbeat Steth Mic message: AAAAAAAAAA that's me!!! OH MY GOSH!!!! JAG ÄR BERÖMD!!! AAAAAAAAAAAAAA!!!!
- use Yaru login sound 
- do it like Twitch Streamlabs donation ding 
- I know, the drawing is horrible. I was not supposed to draw 2D! I am supposed to draw 3D! yess.
- Error! NO Swedish language experience. Falling back to Google Translate.
- LWIAY
