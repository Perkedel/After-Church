# How did I get all the Ubuntu sounds?
get Ubuntu at https://ubuntu.com  
install it at the second drive, second partition, or in a container a.k.a. Virtual Machine. figure out how you take out the file. sorry for not having the tutorial right now.

Questions from https://askubuntu.com/questions/138760/how-do-i-change-the-start-up-sound 
It was in here: `/usr/share/sounds/`

Now you see bunch of Folders here.

Version history: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ubuntu_version_history  
Today, as of Ubuntu 19.04 and up I think..., the theme sound is at folder `Yaru`. idk why is named that. is it because it was theme of `Yaru` in this Gnome Desktop? idk.

you can `cp /usr/share/sounds/Yaru /media/yourUsername/C_drive/To/where/youd/like/to/put/these-at`. Basically, Right Click, copy `Yaru` folder here, to wherever you'd like the folder be placed. **Copy the folder! not Cut!**. Even you hate Linux. Please Unhate Linux and hate proprietarism, expensivism, and partialism instead.

surprise surprise! **It has a brand new startup sound!!** and again, is unused. I do not want to use sound player invokes at startup for sake of *enabling startup sound*, that's stupid nowadays I think. Must be there a config file here to let these on, maybe using `Debconf`, tweakers or something registry editor idk.  
btw here's how to enable startup sound [here](https://askubuntu.com/questions/258589/how-do-i-enable-system-sounds )

.

To me, it's unpleasant for Linux is not known for their sound unlike Windows does for their signature sounds. what the peck?

..

btw, you'd like to take all sounds in that Linux installation? go ahead! it's yours too. nobody have right to sue you for using it, but Remember! **credit is more respectful than not.**

# Spoiler Alert!
Following product is ineligible for Anti-spoiler prevention due to violation of certain rule and will be shown here:

Miscelaneous Spoiler ft. Perkedel Cinematic Universe:
- Misfortune's index of happiness is beyond Finland in total (7.769, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Happiness_Report as of 29 May 2020 23.14 )!!! Wanna know? her score is 8164. Crazy! Wow. The Death Realm took care of Happiness here so well, than earth does! idk if you gonna be mad, but it's a fanfic idea, relax.
- Misfortune is the first citizen of Death realm to possess Netherite materials, even before snapshot 1.16 was a thing!!!
- Misfortune is the first Swedish to experience HP bar so-called "Undead mode", heart with infinity symbol on it. This is survival mode where essentially you cannot die even the HP is 0. It is unlike HP 0 sensor & undying like it does on most multiplayer servers, however. This one is single player compatible and works out of the box.
- I don't like (& hate it when) Misfortune being litterally ***Unfortunate***. So I just give her litterally every **Lucky 🍀** things (from this day of Death Realm) so she's not so **bad luck** after all. Despite at 16 Sparkles, it may not help so much, even finally had another child named Dito (boy). Tragic death (non-age death) to me, always reduce hearts into atoms. poof! 💔 
- I injected the resurrection to Misfortune couple days ago. I set timeline at virtual 25 September 2019. and then brought entire Openfield villager to Dasandim before the pandemic starts in late December 2019. fanfic yeah!
- Grevor teleported Fran Bow into the resurrector machine room during the resurrector annual maintenance. He just found easy to resurrect spirit and found Fran Bow because she's *Alive and Aliven't*. The location is the same, Death Realm.
- Ary will be released in 28 July 2020. We hope Valdi is not on earth. Not funny if it is. Today, N95 masks are scarce.. yess. and I don't want to risk outsiding.
- https://fran-bow.fandom.com/wiki/Fran_Bow_Dagenhart
- https://littlemisfortune.fandom.com/wiki/Callista_Ramirez_Hernandez (How did you figure out this event? I think 16 sparkles wasn't helping for long..)
- https://littlemisfortune.fandom.com/wiki/Misfortune_Ramirez_Hernandez (Apparently, the laziness was found when the name is not following -son prefix of Sweden naming law).
- We injected better raise up adoption mod during Death realm, as well as if on earth, the school bully may exist. However, this mod is not a Forge, not ModLoader, not Fabric, not Bukkit Plugin, not Datapack, neither of all.
- https://littlemisfortune.fandom.com/wiki/Mr._Voice (This guy steals children on Pandora)
- Aha! I know. the end of Morgo's game were now in 2009, right? right?? ***➡?!?!?!?!*** idk. which figures the bad end where this mother decided to `/kill` (just like that and Enter) or whatever measure it takes if you forgot to sparkle 16 objects. **👉?** And.. otherwise if you did 16 sparkles, `/kill` weren't happened. idk.
- Supernova GIMP light flare effect
- Misfortune's pounding heartbeat Steth Mic message: AAAAAAAAAA that's me!!! OH MY GOSH!!!! JAG ÄR BERÖMD!!! AAAAAAAAAAAAAA!!!!
- use Yaru login sound 
- do it like Twitch Streamlabs donation ding 
- I know, the drawing is horrible. I was not supposed to draw 2D! I am supposed to draw 3D! yess.
- Error! NO Swedish language experience. Falling back to Google Translate.
- LWIAY

# Error Acknowledge
Sorry for errors! it's tiring to rerender these all over again. might fix soon, but if that was on a format I wasn't supposed to do at, I skipped that over.
- forgot the button and strings on Misfortune's robe 
- Thumbnail of Silent night. the source could've been the MIDI download. but since it is picture compilation, I decided to link the Github of that thumbnail svg instead. so, here's MIDI download https://open.lbry.com/@JOELwindows7:a/Hatsune-Miku-Silent-Night-MIDI-XGlite:f?r=A17C6o74QvCNS1FeEqW6ny8MsCdgCfHb and the recording when played on a sophisticated MIDI player https://open.lbry.com/@JOELwindows7:a/Hatsune-Miku-Silent-Night-MIDI-XGlite-AUDIO-PSR-S975:b?r=A17C6o74QvCNS1FeEqW6ny8MsCdgCfHb
- The Misfortune's pounding heartbeat scream "I AM FAMOUS!!!" in Swedish. I use Google Translate. This is wrong translate probably. I'd like if her heartbeat screams such word that includes exagerations (not with swear yet), but Google Translate couldn't help with that. for those who are originally Swedish, you can help me if you wish. thancc for your help.
- -Grammar error! unintentional error! should've "did not receive **any** comment"-
- missing malmary bump! ok I forgot that, sorry. I don't want to draw 2D. I'll fix that in Blender 3D make.
- characteristic might seems wrong here. idk if it is.
- is Papa Hernandez alive or not before Grevor came? idk. As far as I know, I believe in best ending, I would like to extend that Hernandez back, repent, and stuff like that. because, you have all the required happiness.
- Olive bug high pitch render. Oh I know! you restart olive, open project again, play it little bit. then render. that should work the problem around.
- Forgot `We Love Darktoner` easter egg in the video! but the dark mode in majority of the video should marks it.

# Before the 4th wall is broken
- Misfortune felt familiar scene during the intro
- Misfortune impressed with that Minecraft Hotbar arrangement after the AfterChurch logo appears
- Misfortune is then inspired to become Video LBRYian after seeing Swift way to make videos 
- Papa Hernandez surprised at the earrape part. and then "Oh, my gosh, Joel! don't do that! My ear is old!"
- Mama Callista popped with that Yamaha DGX-305 as the family had exact unit in 2005 for their children, but theirs are Yamaha DGX-505 which is more looked like an electric piano, but same interface.
- Rimborn Gayarsaran told everyone in the room that he's about to break the 4th wall and give access to its hole to the family including Grevor's after the confession has been finished.
- Misfortune and her family Yikes forever to YouTube for scronching any comments that contains `Communist Bandits` in Chinese as that gives a sense that YouTube is a... Yikes Forever. Man! I can't say explicitly. I could be sued and downtook, in YouTUbe. and more centralized websites.
