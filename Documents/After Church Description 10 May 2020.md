# After Church
A Television show about random wildness of contents of JOELwindows7 in his life. As well as assets information broadcast & acknowledgement requests. I mean, We tell what's the name of that song used, and what's that song you use? what's the name? where do we get it.

And more!

## Meant to be broadcasted after church time.
on Sunday, about 6 PM. with at least 10 Minutes filled so that *Centralized video hoster* can recognize it as Monetizably viable perhaps.

## Contains Informations!
Can be boring! Dislike invitors! **Controvercial!!!**

Or

Can be intresting! Invites Likes! **Phenomenal!!!**

## Typically consists of
- Random contents! Gameplay, Videos of mine, memes!!! **Yellow Advertisement time**!!!
- Songs, MIDI, and more assets, informations; both telling their name & request of their name plus the source link in case search engine did not understand the meaning of this.
- Rants & Adores!
