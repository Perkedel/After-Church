Yay. We are having bad lucks. it is even beyond the mythical numbers and superstition! Amazing!

We have Outbreaks! We have eik serkats! We have everything we can't imagine!

Yay. Cool and Good. I am not sportmanship at all, lol!

# After Church
A Television show about random wildness of contents of JOELwindows7 in his life. As well as assets information broadcast & acknowledgement requests. I mean, We tell what's the name of that song used, and what's that song you use? what's the name? where do we get it.

And more!

## Meant to be broadcasted after church time.
on Sunday, about 6 PM. with at least 10 Minutes filled so that *Centralized video hoster* can recognize it as Monetizably viable perhaps.

## Contains Informations!
Can be boring! Dislike invitors! **Controvercial!!!**

Or

Can be intresting! Invites Likes! **Phenomenal!!!**

## Typically consists of
- Random contents! Gameplay, Videos of mine, memes!!! **Yellow Advertisement time**!!!
- Songs, MIDI, and more assets, informations; both telling their name & request of their name plus the source link in case search engine did not understand the meaning of this.
