Killmonday Games.
Why did you do this?!
You scronched a little girl using a timely (1993) relevant car that has no collision prevention system at that time, brought her middle road and then strike her in time, but injected event redirection which later to be pulled back off at the end of the game as Morgue was scronched by Benjamin the fox.
What the peck is this sorcery, Killmonday? don't you see how heart broken am I, looking this poor little girl Eik Serkat then went to the Death Realm, and these 16 Sparkles player found were used to install Eternal Happiness to Ramirez the mother and that's end?!
Dang, brother! that's savage! story 0 out 100, gameplay 95 out of 100.
Fine. I'm gonna inject resurrection in 25 September 2019, bring entire Openfield citizens to Dasandim because Pandemic is about to start in late December 2019 and 2020 will be terrible. Yeah Year XX20 Virus Season, you know. and I made Grevor did resurrect Misfortune & renamed her to Miss Fortune to make it lucky.
Also added during the age of her in death realm, I made her grow to be Pro Gamer, I mean proficient Minecrafter as you can see in the bootscreen previously. You see that Sparkler before the Glowstone, Yes, Hotbar No. 8 ! Notice that HP bar with Infinity symbol. It means she's in Undead Mode Survival. Just her soul, she's died in HP bar Hardcore but in here the Spirit Soul brought to such Realm instead of become Spectator.
Ok. Basically I'll fork your universe and usually won't ask you permission as my Perkedel Cinematic universe contains a lot of fanfictions here. We extended the story from the official and make better ends, fix something bad, improve more on something. Then publish such game for Linux and share them to some sort of network like LBRY, itch, or whatever.
But here I do ask permission if I want to publish my game to proprietary or expensive platform like AppStore, Google Play, etc. etc.
How much your license cost? $3000, $4K, $10K, or what? Thanks.

Also after now live in Dasandim, I think, she has a better hiding spot which is placed inside Ender Chest. And you should know, if you are playing Minecraft right now, especially with multiplayer either LAN or Server, the content of Ender Chest is yours. and if another player accessed that same Ender Chest, it contains that player's inventory.
i.e., Only Misfortune can access her hiding spot, in the Ender Chest. Yeah!!!
It's just an idea though. Living inside Ender Chest is not always a good idea since it can glitch one day.
If she has to, then she has to place 2 Ender Chest. one in Grevor's house, one again in a secret bunker somewhere in Dasandim. That way, the Ender Chest acts like bridge. she enters one Ender Chest, select location to open at, which to the secret bunker, and open in that secret bunker and close it again. Now she's safe, noone but her can access her hiding spot unless the location has been compromised. Only she knows the location of the secret bunker. It is much less secure however, but safer compared to inside Ender Chest.
In case of Ender Chest gets broken, She has to also build Nether Portal passage that by default is turned off. So she can turn it on, go to nether, portal off, and find another nether portal, portal on, and go back to Grevor's house, portal off.

# Before Compilation Next
I basically mocked Killmonday Games AB, especially those who are responsible with the plot line part, for deciding Misfortune to Eik Serkat in any way player's decided Left or Right.

C'mon. idk how about you. But it turns out, it made Callista and Hernandez repent their bad action, start over better, made Dito (boy) and Rara (girl) in 1999. But it doesn't help their regret because "Misfortune" only exist once in this cinematic universe instance. 
They kept wishing Eternally, until at this point (my fork of the cinematic universe to here in Perkedel) in 25 September 2019 (I decided to put this plot 2 weeks after First Launch release), Grevor came to Sweden in Earth, roam around from IKEA, saw "anti-gravity furnitures" hung in the ceiling and flabbergasted about it, buy furnitures and tools there, go get meatballs, have fun around, and ended up in Pandora, encountered graveyards, saw this gravestone "Misfortune", then Resurrect everyone Eik Serkat (which only works for those who Eik Serkat Tragically, not because of age).
Done! everyone Eik Serkat not by age alive again, missing children, alive again. The family Hernandez have thought done eternal mistake for the rest of the cinematic universe span, well it is, but now given 2nd chance. Yeah, it's a privillege to have this Dasandim Resurrection Alliance to help. 
Oh no! We got a bad feeling about this! a virus pandemic is about to start in late December 2019, Dasandimian thought as Grevor and everyone in Dasandim and those with jobs on earth. Yep, time to move to Dasandim before December, including the entire house. Also carry entire Pandora district as well to Dasandim, all of them.
Ok. that was just a speculation, if not true then they're gonna sent back to earth, right intact like never been moved. I hope. also hopefully it's just that and in earth they can start whatever never been done which is caring this mature Misfortune albeit, like when she was 8, carying 3 children of them to malls, IKEA, entertainment area, whatever tour on earth there is.
OH YOU ARE WRONG!! It's no longer bad feeling! it's real!! the Earth has virus pandemic! really real!! OH PECK! You now stuck in Dasandim! No earth holiday! No earth IKEA. Only do this 2nd chance of caring, in Dasandim.

btw, we have alot of stuffs in Dasandim. We have malls, but it's only 10 times the Dubai. there's however bigger one and the biggest in this cinematic universe, the Sloantim Donut Mall, 10 light years from Dasandim. extraordinary big! check it out! it's a donut mall, with giant star at the donut hole. basiccaly the donut surround the giant star. so big, even it only had about 20% occupance. it's also the government center of Sloantim Cluster. Europe but it's space. part of galaxy like continent and planets like each country.

Work from Dasandim.
Stay at Dasandim, be creative.

I'm sorry. I cannot help. I am looking if the situation could be better next time. So you can go back home, and 2nd chance caring on earth, originally.

wait. Oh I know. survival like usual, but no tangibility or extremly weak tangibility and visibility. that's how ghost works.

and you know what? what if I put this event where Misfortune's soul occassionally observe the parents, during anything, 2 brand new children, tour somewhere, and until this point she get resurrected, and still preserve the grown up evolution level. Yeah, because, Misfortune has been fostered there in Death Realm, and she can visit Earth dimension anytime, albeit as a gamemode of spectator.

I thought you are a bad person. Now I think, you have incomplete story line. I have to resurrect characters that Eik Serkat tragically.
Ok this time, I cancel the mock. forget the mock. I delete the mock. that's it. we have to see it.

aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa

oh btw, should I rename Misfortune into Fortune so it became Miss Fortune? idk. still thinking this.
I heard it's because of "her misfortune" due to certain circumstances I understand, but I cannot talk here explicitly right now.
