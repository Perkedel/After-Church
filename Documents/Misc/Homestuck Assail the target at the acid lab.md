Officer Yusuf Nelson: (driving & going to arrive).... (arrived) (brake).. Okay, There they are.

(Bafius LLC building is a warehouse)

Yusuf: (open tablet to see infiltration path), Now, we have figured out how to infiltrate this. There is this vent right here, idk why did they made it so big, but anyways, you guys go here.

Terezi Pyrope: SOUNDS L1K3 4N 1MPOSTOR 4MONG US, DO3SN'T 1T? üòÜ LOL!

Yusuf: Pretty much. And it's fortunate, they made this mistake. Well, I've handed it off to you, check watch and track him slowly.

Vriska Serket: Yes, officer.

Yusuf: Great luck.

Vriska: (open right back door)!

Yusuf: And no portal immediately, no idea. They might see us.

Vriska: Okay.. (open door & leave)

Aradia Megido: (also go through right door)

Tavros Nitram: (also go through right door)..

Yusuf: Use it wisely, only when it's ready.
