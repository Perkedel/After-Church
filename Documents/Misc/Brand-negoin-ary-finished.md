# Harnoid Exoid Theory Fly
What happened? We have our time at looped. It was her actually.

# Crocus vs Ary 
So Crocus wants to have it all. then Ary came to prevent him to take it all. that's it.

Oh wait. hold on. Before Ary did travel this. she saw much worse thing had happened. so she **Back to the Past** to hack it all out.  
Oh so the timeline mode is `Transactional`. mkay. Affect the past, affect the present. not to be confused with uh.. `Donor` like Marvel. Affect the Pass, No affect Present. Probably?!

And then, if Crocus clean is here, then that Dark Crocus also time traveled, right?? ummm.. okay idk.

And so this war kept happened until this timeline Ary go here Samh... help forget, and Dark crocus take, bla bla bla..

Ary Dark version want to put Dark Crocus to time vault oh wait Clean Crocus want to replace it. Now he's the one take place in time prison. in Samharind. ok Samharind, the same thing vault right? or.. oh no. don't! ok, 2. whatever.

and that Crocus clean sacrifice broke the loop out of it.

and now Clean Ary would like to master time traveler?
