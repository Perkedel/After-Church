image thumb idea: We sold this mod to X0p1r4t3 Eenvreensment, here's explanation

# Last Funkin Moments: Incondusive

After we have temporarily suspended our contract due to Kaorfa's side job, we have witnessed that the day still becomes incondusive, unfortunately, as usual it is.

And Spoiler alert, I decided to graduate 90% of Wakturia workforce here, because the day has been incondusive to me. I cannot further risk this, because being banned for the ***rights*** is not a good idea at all. I shall keep my accounts alive as long as possible. I asked why it's down, deleted. I asked what's kenny is all about, blocked. We hoped that this one last out three mods here to come back just like previous two, nothing come back ever. And other things right in here, and everywhere. I thought some particular talented creators & high order people there are nice, they aren't. Really I am disappointed with you all.

You may see nothing in where you stand right now, but you should see the rubbles I have collected in where the Cause stands. Mind you that these rubbles as always will not be shipped with the main binary to ensure that it is legal for everyone.

Edit: Kaorfa has been laid off. the manager for Kaorfa's side job is currently requesting position and still haven't got news to this day.

## Lore: Incondusive

### Begin

#### Wakturia, Dasandim

(everyone already sat on their table)

Gyouter Embinosa: (walk from enter door to front stage).. .. . . . . .. . . ., (put phone in mimbar), (grab mic close to mouth).. (turn on mic). uhh, Ahei Dasandimian. Good morning.

Latsufir: ... Morning!

Gyouter: (glaze towards Latsufir & thought the dangers already exposed to over the past few months).... So, uh.. Welcome back to physical session again. I'm sorry that you have to come physically this time. We have received order from Kaorfa last week ago, that...

Latsufir Umnaga: ...

Gyouter: We're going to graduate some of you folks.

*everyone*: (complains)!!!!!!!!

Gyouter: Yea yea yea, I know know, you don't like this. Me too! But.. uhh that's for you people, who.. monitors the conditions in here. I have no idea that you still have assignment in outside this office, even outside job time, coz guess what, you are alot, you love what you doing, and that's cool and good. And by that I mean, (breath mouth in)... You see.. No! No you see. (breath mouth in again)sssff, mmmm, you folks ever been gagged, blocked, any harm you got while you're doing your extra assignment or internal assignment..

*some*: (raise hand)

Gyouter: Yeah, I see you all, uh (raise) me too.

Latsufir: (raise hand)!

Gyouter: We cannot do this everyday anymore. It was really fun, when our enemies got infuriated, and threat us. That gives us this... what is it?.. the motivating sensation, making us wants to further torture them, to exhaustion. Until they give up, and release everything they held hostage, so we can spread it all to all gamers across galaxies. No. Unfortunately it's different anymore. Nothing like used to be. Nowadays, the threat, same threat.. but.. it will.. (nchap) also, (nchap) uh.. hit other innocents that had nothing to do with us. I can feel it, no proof, but I can feel that this could happen. No we can't have that. They should only hit us, and that's the rule of the game. NOoo, they knew now, they evolved. not only getting smarter, but.. got more tricks generated under their sleeves. Look at those people that would have to die in vain, only because we want to tell the truth to all gamers across the galaxies. It's awry. very awry.

*everyone*: (sobs) 😢....

Gyouter: So now, we're graduating some, very many. other branch of Wakturia have been closed, all of them around Sloantim, we're the only one left. ANd now some of you has to go.

Malore: When?!

Gyouter: Now. Today. Pls, take the graduations. the vote still ongoing, those who still graduate or wants to go now, please stand up.

*some*: (start stand up)..

Gyouter: Okay good. Note, it must leave only 30 actives in this role as the result, no less. (sit down in mimbar hair).

*some*: (more stand ups)!!

....

Gyouter: Yes! Okay..

....

Gyouter: Keep going, until we left 30.

....

........

...

..

...

..

.

Gyouter: Okay, is that all?

Neshim M'neer: We will left 36.

Gyouter: 36, okay. who's left? (saw Latsufir & Sky)... Latsufir?

Latsufir: Yes?

Gyouter: You don't want to.. resign?

Latsufir: ...

Gyouter: I know you're confused. But you're the most precious person here, for you have been giving us alot of ideas back then.

Latsufir: I mean, who's going to give idea then?

Gyouter: I'm sorry but... No no, you can stay if you want, but I can't bare to see you being risked to a deadly hallows whereever missions go. No, you're like my *only child*. Not to mention, (see Sky)..

Sky: Huh? ... 

Gyouter: We're not going to have idea anymore. The shift of this entire alliance is now moved
 towards... **replications**. We are now only going to reinstance whatever we saw outside, across the multiverse. And I believe that, it only takes... redrawing. less of an idea and strategies. We are not going to depend on the company that hold every multiverse. it's going to be fully our own story.

Latsufir: Okay..

Gyouter: No, I do not want to say that you're useless now, who said that?, I just.. can't bare if I have to lose *my children* one by one, and other innocents one by one. You remember when you almost got murdered by Obul there? He's the most dangerous person ever. 

Latsufir: ... ... Well, I have life. (stand up)

Sky: (Stand up).

Gyouter: (look back towards everyone)...

*everyone*: (follow up stand up bit by bit)...

Gyouter: Okay. (find chair on his left) I wish I can also get out. But, I still have contract here.. (sitt)., That's to... ... mch, Do you really wanna know? bet you don't wanna know, coz you can guess. ...

(camera view overall)...

Gyouter: ....... Now, thank you for your service....., the final check will soon be processed, delivered to your house, and your wallet. ..., As usual, `Wakturia`, that public ID.........

*everyone*: (listening carefully).....

Gyouter: (look around the room)....

Jonathan Podosheryen: (come to Gyouter & notify) Sir, the stand ups have been listed. The graduation is processing.

Gyouter: Okay. Good.

Jonathan: .. Wish you great luck man, (pat worryful)! ! !.

Gyouter: It's alright. I can do this. I hope... ... (rember the data already processed but everyone still stood up) Oh!, you can sit now.

*everyone*: (sitt)!!..

Gyouter: No job today. Well then. Speaking about preservation, uhh... Think I... gonna... save it here, (create memo to employee)....., (save). Kay, read it when you're home. Now, even if you have been graduated, there's still one job left to do, and we expect you come. the next memo about will appear soon. Read & save as soon you receive it, okay? No no, just.. come. It's to uh... pay respect one last time. Because you know, We are still waiting for the Full Ass to come. Be patient, I am still hopeful they come. And I hope you still remember that, when it comes, we stop. Go to the place we have set, say goodbye to these people at hand, and the.. cleaner will port everything up, etc etc etc. Just like that!

*everyone*: (mumble 2 second) ye ye.....

Gyouter: Any question?

...

...

...

...

Gyouter: Wow, no question? Latsufir?

Latsufir: ......

Gyouter: Okay, If you want to keep Sky, who's going to stop you? Well, that's what you would ask?

Latsufir: Oh yeah..

Gyouter: Yeah, that. Now. ...  .... that's it. Class dismissed. Remember, read all notes, come back when we tell you **immediately to the spot** when Full Ass comes, and that's all, you're free to be lost somewhere. Yeah. sss.. yeah.

*everyone*: (start packing up & go home)!!

Gyouter: Okay, just be slow, there's no rush here, the... Full Ass.. will come.. *shortly*.. I hope.. yeah..

*everyone*: (still packing and bring home)....

Gyouter: Right..

### Handovers

#### Salt flat world

Latsufir: (read the memo) What??

Sky: (also read her phone) Oh..

Latsufir: Ummm.. You got any idea why is that?

Sky: Wasn't that about the ***preservation*** thingy?

Latsufir: Oh yeah..

> We sold Last Funkin Moment to X0p1r4t3 Eenvreensment.  
> (Gyouter)

Sky: I felt rumor that Kaorfa is about to yoink not just some functions but also... properties too.

Latsufir: is that so?

Sky: idk, just a rumor.

#### Logistic Area, X0p1r4t3 Eenvreensment

Roig Hermalansa: Hey, be careful boys. If you break that we're going to lose it all. I mean, we have a copy here, but it's never a guarantee.

Info: 2 strong men moving the [heavy crate](https://github.com/Perkedel/Perkedel-Minecraft-Java-World ) from a truck into this smaller carriage. 2 pallete hand forklift on each opposing end due to how heavy this is. Truck wheel is as ground level as the smaller carriage, container bed lined up together, with adjusting the smaller carriage container bed height, as the truck does not have adjustable bed height.

Duduk Segar: (grunt pulling) UUUUUUUUUGHH.......

Alam Segar: You can do this brother, (grunt pushing) HEUYYYYYYYYYYY....

Info: the standard forklift car is ironically broke, the hydraulic pump is, because the crate is too heavy & the car is way too old.

Besek: (done fixed the pump) Okay! try again.

Fufus: (try lift the fork)....

(back tank exploded) (async) DUAR 💥💥💥💥💥💥💥💥!!!!!

Fufus: (async) HEUAAA!!!! ... What??

Besek: 🤦🤦🤦🤦🤦🤦🤦🤦 Argh...

Duduk: (both finished ) DOOOOOOOOOOOONE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! (relieve) HOOoooh... (realize there is one more [heavy crate](https://github.com/Perkedel/bla-bla-mcpe ) in the truck) Wait..

Alam: (stress again)....

Gyouter: Hey.

Roig: Oh, excuse me. (look Gyouter), Sir??

Gyouter: You got.. time?

Roig: Yes sir. What can I do?

Gyouter: Nothing just.. umm.. (point to his truck) that one.

Roig: Okay? (look at the truck)..., (open).... (saw crate) Is that?

Gyouter: Hm.

Roig: What's this?

Gyouter: (telepathy).

Roig: Wait? [That package](https://github.com/Perkedel/Kaded-fnf-mods )??? But..

Gyouter: I'm sorry, we've been *slackelini* over the past few months. We suddenly got, unexpected stagnancy. Apparently Kaorfa was been.... digging some monet, you know, he got none, so he's desperate.

Roig: mm.. You told Admiral about this?

Gyouter: I did. Last week. And he okay, take it.

Roig: Oh okay. ..

Gyouter: Tell Zumi. Take care of this well. He can do anything with it to add stuffs into it. I gotta job to do, and apparently it's no longer close to [that one](https://github.com/Perkedel/Kaded-fnf-mods ).

Roig: Yes sir. I'll hand these over. You sure about this? What if they know about this? Weren't you supposed to handle this?

Gyouter: Don't worry. I hope it's fine. And.. Kaorfa had trouble, he couldn't handle this anymore now. Now it's your turn to ***preserve*** this, while I gotta help Kaorfa fight other stuffs.

Roig: Yeah yeah. And next, do you still know, Conservationist hates sparsdators like us? The mod creators in your sector you've been working on are nototorious being Conversationist. If one of them knew, they'll take down your mod.

Gyouter: I know. ... But you know who else can we trust?

(camera view far overall scene).......

Roig: Dang.... .... uh.. nobody.. Is there the backup in other planet?

Gyouter: Kaorfa has also ordered shutdown to all branches. Now it's only us. There is a change in the management.

Roig: (remember speaking about the change) To the... (look down) harrassment eradications.... (look back up to Gyouter)!..

Gyouter: Please. We beg you. You're the only one that can be trusted, to keep this file, while we're moving to fight harrassment around the universe.

Roig: Yes.

Gyouter: see you later, (go back to left passenger seat of the truck), (open door), (ride up), (sitt), (close door)!!, (attach seatbelt), (contemplate for the next battle)...

Duduk: (did lifted up the Last Funkin Moment crate) Hey this crate is light!!

Alam: 😊

### Changes in Management. The Next day

#### Back to Wakturia command center

Info: There is Query, Mistletoe, and.. oh that's it. there should be others but they aren't yet processed.

Gyouter: (preparing mimbar)....

Query Sandros Ambasador: Hoo hoo hoo, I'm excited! Tell us now! what do we do here?

Gyouter: No, we're not doing here. You'll have new place... (still finding the briefing file).... damn where the.. Ah, here, (open file)! Okay. So.. We are establishing an initiative.

Query: Okay, listening!

Gyouter: Right.

> Over the past few years there has been tremendous numbers of case of harrassment campaigns targeted towards innocent creators.  
> Reasons ranges from plain random to rather specific hatreds towards issues beyond anyone's perceptions.  
> Here, the purpose of the initiative to band together across the galaxies and help each other pin point who criminals that are confirmed a harrasser, active, and inactive that did causes terribly fatal losses both quanity & quality.  
> The scope of this initiative shall focus only towards these harrassers, unless otherwise noted.  
> Citizens are welcome to contribute every intels as much as possible that lead to the capture of those harrassers.

Gyouter: Aand so on. You got the copy in your hand. Read it. Any question?

Misteltoe Ambasador: (could not find place in this document) 🙋‍♂️ Question please.

Gyouter: Yes.

Mistletoe: I fail to find the place. Know where is it? did you have intel?

Gyouter: Oh yeah, the document was writter 2 months ago before we got the place. Now I got it, see memo, it's........ **Sorrow City**.

Query: OH BACK TO MY HOME YEYY!!!

Mistletoe: Also, you going to lead this initiative??

Gyouter: Sorry, but I can't. that's beyond my scope here. I'll watch the timeline. So the leader is... You. Query.

Query: (excited) MEEEEEEE??!?!?!... (pogchamp to back)!??!!!???!!??

Mistletoe: Well congratulations. But it won't be easy

Query: Oh.. (nodding) yeah.. okay.. I know. (stop nodding). (turn head slowly back to front again)....., What do I do?

Gyouter: Lead your people. Tell them the mission, and foster your people, both in mission and break time. Now uh..

(camera zoom out overall scene)

Gyouter: Just you two?

Mistletoe: Yes?

Gyouter: That's intentional for Dasandim node. Aaand, you, will have special guest. We have special guest.

Query: 😀 Oh yeah?!

Gyouter: That's right. You gotta thancc Kaorfa for this. Coz he brought just for you, gamers, your old friend you always see them as fictional, now real.

Query: Oh.. Who are they? there's alotta show gone real. What is it this time?

Gyouter: (telepathy `Homestuck`)...

Query: Whoah... Yoo..... Really?! TODAY?!??!?

Gyouter: Today.

Query: **WOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!!!!!** Oh my God... Ain't no pecking **WAAAY**!!

Mistletoe: Oh.. I think we need to buy Terezi blind cane

Gyouter: No need, no need. They have been cured. All of them.

Query: (even more excited)!?!??!?!

Mistletoe: Well, then no extra pay. Great haha.. hmm wonder how they look like..

Gyouter: Just like normal. Although because they've just cured, it'll take some time for the alternate habits to vanish first. Don't be surprised if Terezi still tapping around. She can see, but her habit still in place. ... (realization, Terezi was later cured canon in official Homestuck).. Oh wait, I just realized.

Mistletoe: Yes, no more Xavier wheelchair needed. God, that'd be expensive if we had to, whew.

Gyouter: YEah, yeah, yeah. Tavros can stand. there we got it. Vriska got left eye and side pupils cured, all etc.

Query: We're going to have homestuck mates guys!!! (asnyc) (give Mistletoe five)!!!

Mistletoe: (async) (receive five)!!! .... Wait, is it only us here?

(camera zoom out overall until)

Mistletoe: Hello? ...

(stop zoom overall)

Gyouter: Well uh.. Let's say uh..

### Reject join. Family Guy cutaway

Trooks: Bulls888! Not going to touch this topic again after what they did to me.

Fezer Rumag: You can just be a citizen. If you find any hints of harrasser, upload the picture and the location and all data to us.

Trooks: (look sharp to Fezer)???.... Okay, fine. If I got hurt, you're responsible. Other than that, (open portal)!! Thanks but no. (enter), (close)!!

Fezer: hmm...

### Return back again to scene

Mistletoe: Welp. But atleast we got gamers.

Gyouter: I hope. But the fear of reporting is still present, that's the issue. Which is why we ask some gamers to join. aaand, did not believe our super protection law & physical in sorrow city. Yeah.

Mistletoe: Maybe we should one day open up tour for all gamers across galaxies. Won't hurt I guess.

Gyouter: Good idea. For now though, we're going to do the mission. The homestuck people will come shortly to your home city. Get to know them, great luck, and God bless you.

Query: Oooo yeah!! Awesome!!!

Gyouter: Oh would you like to open portal after that door? We start now. I want you safe.

Mistletoe: Sure, go ahead!

Gyouter: Alright, (open portal to their home, upon the command center big door)!! Okay, Great luck and God bless you.

Query: Let's goo!!! Wait, where exactly my job?

Gyouter: Downstreet, in the Police department. That department is now the Interpol. Intergalactic police.

Query: oooOOOOOOooo...

Gyouter: Okay.

Mistletoe: C'mon bro let's go!

Query: Oh yeah!

#### outside command center, Basement, Wakturia

Gyouter: Okay, gamers. If you got any trouble, just contact us. I am also assigned as the support guy for this interpol initiative. Well, there's alot. I'll be handling this exclusively now, so you got issue, don't hesitate to call me up, okay?

Mistletoe: Okay!

Gyouter: Now, let's go.

Mistletoe: Thancc, sir! (enter portal)
