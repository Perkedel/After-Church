# Last Funkin Moments: Incondusive

After we have temporarily suspended our contract due to Kaorfa's side job, we have witnessed that the day still becomes incondusive, unfortunately, as usual it is.

And Spoiler alert, I decided to graduate 90% of Wakturia workforce here, because the day has been incondusive to me. I cannot further risk this, because being banned for the ***rights*** is not a good idea at all. I shall keep my accounts alive as long as possible. I asked why it's down, deleted. I asked what's kenny is all about, blocked. We hoped that this one last out three mods here to come back just like previous two, nothing come back ever. And other things right in here, and everywhere. I thought some particular talented creators & high order people there are nice, they aren't. Really I am disappointed with you all.

You may see nothing in where you stand right now, but you should see the rubbles I have collected in where the Cause stands. Mind you that these rubbles as always will not be shipped with the main binary to ensure that it is legal for everyone.

## Lore: Incondusive

### Begin

#### Wakturia, Dasandim

(everyone already sat on their table)

Gyouter Embinosa: (walk from enter door to front stage).. .. . . . . .. . . ., (put phone in mimbar), (grab mic close to mouth).. (turn on mic). uhh, Ahei Dasandimian. Good morning.

Latsufir: ... Morning!

Gyouter: (glaze towards Latsufir & thought the dangers already exposed to over the past few months).... So, uh.. Welcome back to physical session again. I'm sorry that you have to come physically this time. We have received order from Kaorfa last week ago, that...

Latsufir Umnaga: ...

Gyouter: We're going to graduate some of you folks.

*everyone*: (complains)!!!!!!!!

Gyouter: Yea yea yea, I know know, you don't like this. Me too! But.. uhh that's for you people, who.. monitors the conditions in here. I have no idea that you still have assignment in outside this office, even outside job time, coz guess what, you are alot, you love what you doing, and that's cool and good. And by that I mean, (breath mouth in)... You see.. No! No you see. (breath mouth in again)sssff, mmmm, you folks ever been gagged, blocked, any harm you got while you're doing your extra assignment or internal assignment..

*some*: (raise hand)

Gyouter: Yeah, I see you all, uh (raise) me too.

Latsufir: (raise hand)!

Gyouter: We cannot do this everyday anymore. It was really fun, when our enemies got infuriated, and threat us. That gives us this... what is it?.. the motivating sensation, making us wants to further torture them, to exhaustion. Until they give up, and release everything they held hostage, so we can spread it all to all gamers across galaxies. No. Unfortunately it's different anymore. Nothing like used to be. Nowadays, the threat, same threat.. but.. it will.. (nchap) also, (nchap) uh.. hit other innocents that had nothing to do with us. I can feel it, no proof, but I can feel that this could happen. No we can't have that. They should only hit us, and that's the rule of the game. NOoo, they knew now, they evolved. not only getting smarter, but.. got more tricks generated under their sleeves. Look at those people that would have to die in vain, only because we want to tell the truth to all gamers across the galaxies. It's awry. very awry.

*everyone*: (sobs) ðŸ˜¢....

Gyouter: So now, we're graduating some, very many. other branch of Wakturia have been closed, all of them around Sloantim, we're the only one left. ANd now some of you has to go.

Malore: When?!

Gyouter: Now. Today. Pls, take the graduations. the vote still ongoing, those who still graduate or wants to go now, please stand up.

*some*: (start stand up)..

Gyouter: Okay good. Note, it must leave only 30 actives in this role as the result, no less. (sit down in mimbar hair).

*some*: (more stand ups)!!

....

Gyouter: Yes! Okay..

....

Gyouter: Keep going, until we left 30.

....

........

...

..

...

..

.

Gyouter: Okay, is that all?

Neshim M'neer: We will left 36.

Gyouter: 36, okay. who's left? (saw Latsufir & Sky)... Latsufir?

Latsufir: Yes?

Gyouter: You don't want to.. resign?

Latsufir: ...

Gyouter: I know you're confused. But you're the most precious person here, for you have been giving us alot of ideas back then.

Latsufir: I mean, who's going to give idea then?

Gyouter: I'm sorry but... No no, you can stay if you want, but I can't bare to see you being risked to a deadly hallows whereever missions go. No, you're like my *only child*. Not to mention, (see Sky)..

Sky: Huh? ... 

Gyouter: We're not going to have idea anymore. The shift of this entire alliance is now moved
 towards... **replications**. We are now only going to reinstance whatever we saw outside, across the multiverse. And I believe that, it only takes... redrawing. less of an idea and strategies. We are not going to depend on the company that hold every multiverse. it's going to be fully our own story.

Latsufir: Okay..

Gyouter: No, I do not want to say that you're useless now, who said that?, I just.. can't bare if I have to lose *my children* one by one, and other innocents one by one. You remember when you almost got murdered by Obul there? He's the most dangerous person ever. 

Latsufir: ... ... Well, I have life. (stand up)

Sky: (Stand up)
