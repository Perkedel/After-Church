Deovem: Oh.. I see. Great luck. Hey, check again, the mechatronic extracted 13 packages, (count low volume) 1 2 3 4 5 5 6, bl bl 6 and one. Okay thirteen.

### Akibahara ver5.0, Japan Planet

<!-- Karkat land but empty. turns out there's that hostage. the enemy wears suspender. Karkat torn right suspension wire & enemy disfocus, ultimately led to the enemy capture. -->

(saucer docks in the post). (open & extract automatically)

Karkat: (it's empty) HUH? HELLO?? (look left below)..? Euh... (just take it anyway, go off left), (take), (ride bringing the Clipboard)!, (dock clipboard to scanner).

Karkat: (notice the next delivery is 1 package) HMM..

(Mechatronic bringing 1 huge box 2m^3^ exact cube into the saucer)

Karkat: OH.. (about to take clipboard to compare)

Baheul Fur: (missiled the enemy)!!

(duar) ðŸ’¥ðŸ’¥ðŸ’¥ðŸ’¥ðŸ’¥ðŸ’¥!!!

Gug: **OUGGHFF!!!!** (impact & immediately run right towards left of the saucer)

Baheul: Karkat!! suspect escape!!!

Karkat: (grab enemy's back right suspender cloth wire)!!!

(it tears instead)

Gug: AAAGH!!! (disfocus, capture right side of suspender jeans) My suspender!!!

Baheul: (handcuffed with force field cuffs)!!

Gug: (hand pulled to back) OAAA!!! SH88!!!!

Baheul: (continue further straining suspect) Nice catch, Karkat. Whueuh!!

Gug: Oh my God, it's your fault Karkat!! You could've let me off here. I'll give you candy later.

Baheul: (install titanium shut up masker)!, You have right to remain silent. Any word you said will be used against you. Hey, find the hostage!

Gug: (mouth covered tight but not try escape) f888 you!!

Info: found at right side large garbage container.

Toros Milago: (BDSM tied mouth tied) HEEEELP!!!

Morsch: Let's get you out, (pull hostage) UUUUUUUUUUGH!!! (Drop)!, Excuse me!, (take knife & break ties, mouth)!!

Toros: (gasp for air) HHHHHHHHHHH!!!!

Morsch: (upper limbs)!!, (lower limbs), (rest of the ties)!!!

Toros: Ogh, Thank God. (look around) hhh hh, (saw his saucer) Oh sh88!! (immediately go back to saucer)!....... (scan fingerprint to the saucer dash)!

> PILOT CHANGE! Welcome, Milago, Toros.

Toros: (look task & error) C'mon, c'mon.. (task appeared & no complain errors) Okay. Hoof! Wow, Okay, we're good. 1 package. (noticed the clipboard still docked) Who's my replacement?

Karkat: I AM?

Toros: Karkat? Oh wow.

Baheul: He was on the mission to rescue you.

Toros: Wow. Thank you Karkat. C'mon, I got package to deliver, hop in. (sign & submit), (drop it off saucer to the left)!

Baheul: Okay, great luck!

Karkat: (hop in)!

Baheul: You find anything else?

Morsch: No, there's noone else.

Toros: Don't worry about it. This post is manless.

Info: Only in Japan planet where the logistic post has no guard, so much safe it is. Of course, has CCTV. You can say it's because Japan natives are shrinking, but perhaps it's not much of that apparently, since there is cross marriage program of course. And this planet is still new. Well say there has been alot later, nobody here likes to sit doing nothing watching saucer come in & out.

Baheul: Oh wow, what?

Toros: Okay, see you later. (press `PROCEED`)! Let's go.

Toros: (hi greet gesture salute)!!

Rido: (reply salute)!!, (guide saucer to dock).....

(docked)! (saucer auto open & extract)

Rido: Oh yeah here we come!

Toros: Still there's nothing here?

Rido: Nope. Again, just me & my wife. (give Clipboard).

Toros: (take) Guess since it's hot, things gone expensive I see. (dock to scanner).

Drep: (give clipboard) Oh great goodness! Here it is (worryingly look left & right make sure no enemy around)... So, did you see the package content?

Toros: No

Drep: Nah don't worry. Just make sure no enemy is looking that.

Toros: .. Well I'd rather not, coz enemy could've looked at it.

Drep: Good. ... Truck ready?

Rebtilos: (eager to immediately deliver to Protogen Protest Initiative post) Ready!

Drep: Alright, take break. You did well. I'm sorry causing you brought into this (about Toros being held hostage).

(saucer landing).... (portal closed)! ... (landed)!

Mozok: You done?

Toros: Safe and sound.

Mozok: Cool and good. ... Wow. Right, stay safe buddy.

Toros: Thancc, man.

Mozok: I want you safe. You want to reserve other dimension hotel, or uh..

Toros: That's alright. My home is military complex. I'm sure our military can handle this, hopefully.

Mozok: Kay kay. ... Wow, it's time (to go home, already evening).

Toros: (remove harness) Kay, see you later buddy. (open portal to home)!

Mozok: Yeah, I really hope so.

Toros: Wow, this is.. heavy (because he will have long vacation until the initiative is done & had risk being re-kidnapped & could be murdered for this initiative).

Mozok: .... Well don't.. don't worry too much. God help.

Toros: Of course, yess. ... Still..

Mozok: ... yeeeaaaaaa.....

## Post Post Credit flashback

(shown Protogen Patent Partialism presentation)

Mozok: It is with heavy heart, that one of you must volunteer and likely to sacrifice one life to get this mission done. Don't worry, our part here, is to deliver numbers of packages we haven't idea yet, to the place. Who will take it? If nobody take it, unfortunately

Toros: (standup raise hand) Sir!

Mozok: (him?!?! that's insance!)???!!! Wait. You sure?

Toros: That's alright. This is very personal.

Mozok: No, you're the best deliverer in here. You've had alot of experiences. If you die, who will teach the other new crews here? I cannot do multiple task everyday.

Toros: I'm sorry, sir. But uh.. This is out of control. Don't you see how many people have been captured, punished, and possibly... For that?

Mozok: Yes, I know but... Rights to Repair initiative is also everywhere!, don't you think? Why really pick the Protogen one?

Toros: I've been wearing alot of fursonas since I was very young here. My eyes have opened as I looked more, that many of license for every patent out there, is very proprietary. Heck, even those who claim "Open Species", are not so open. There are *DLCs*. This one here, is auction exclusive. This can't go further. We have to bring awareness.

Mozok: (understood)...... Okay. But, maybe choose the worst one here? Wait, we don't have any.

Toros: Then I shall take it. I've seen alot of **lies & traps** from many furry patenters. I'm tired of this. That's why this is personal. If nobody take it, then who shall? (because no awareness, more closed and partial species will manifest)

Mozok: (sad, because he could be murdered for joining this protest).... (whisper) uuuuuuuhgh..... Great luck, .... God bless you ðŸ˜°...

## return to Post credit

### Toros' House, Dasandim Military Alliance

Toros: (walked in) I'm home!

Jinog Milagos (wife): Oh cool! you're home! Yay!

Toros: Honey, ... this is it.

Jinog: Oh... Okay.

Toros: May God help us.

Jinog: yeah.

Toros: Whenever the initiative calls, we got to be ready.

Jinog: Alright.

Toros: Still have my Protogen mask?

Jinog: safe in vault. mine too

Toros: Great. All we do, wait. Don't go beyond this complex.

Jinog: Yes.
