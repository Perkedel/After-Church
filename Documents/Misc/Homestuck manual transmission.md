# Manual Transmission, IS HAAAAAAARD

Family guy inspired moment

The first manual transmission EV prototype. It's basically combustion car, but it's not, the engine is fully an electric motor, otherwise it works like traditional car.

Disclaimer: One car shown does not represent other manual cars accurately. This rough presumption may not work on other car than shown due to certain specifications and other factors.

Yusk Bunok: Okay so, this is manual car. Notice the stick on the console is rather unusual.

Tavros Nitram: oH YEAH, oKAY,,,

Yusk: Now, I'm gonna (hand hold Tavros' head) teach you, whoa Holy, your horn is so soft & smooth, (install manual transmission knowledge).... Okay.

Tavros: aHH, OH, YEA YEA,,, sO,, (full clutch hold), (gear 1), (hold clutch 75% slow tween)...

(Running slowly)

Yusk: Ah yess.. here we go!

Tavros: (add gas 25% slowly)..

Yusk: See you're getting hang of it.

Tavros: (change gear by full clutch & drop gas & change to second gear & nervously)

Yusk: Now you're an expert. Pretty much it!

Yusk: Okay, Vriska, (hold Vriska's head) Here it is. (Install manual transmission knowledge)

Vriska: Oh.. umm okay. (Nervously full clutch), (cluch to 50% slow tween & gas 25% alongside this slow tween)

(Bit sudden car start running)

Yusk: whoaho whow, easy, but you're good!

Vriska: (full clutch release gas quick, change gear, clutch to 75% slow tween again but gas 25% a bit quicker)...

Yusk: Wow you're pro at this!! Yeah, that's basically it.

## End

Help, I still don't get how to Manual, never daily driven it. It's very haaaaard and I stalled it the first time I tried! I only know Clutch is bridge between engine and differential, which can be disconnected partially and is a reason why engine runs, and stalls if suddenly connected while standstill.
