## The next day.
(assembled)

Tambel: Alright, folks. This is the day. You know what to do. Now go!

(begin assembling event)..

Tambel: (go to latex bit cushioned emptied tennis court) Aaand for the twist! Attention for the Sack Hop. This year we got twist. (take one of the bucket of slime prepared for the Pole Climb), This, (spill onto the court)!!, and I want you.. (take a squeegee and spread the slime across as an example)...... Do that. Because last year, the Sack Hop was the easiest one. This Latex provides alot of grip, and people are outsmarting from this environment. I want you people make this court the slipperiest possible. Don't too much, coz this slime here.. Not sure this breathable, just have enough, make it too slippery to rely on.

Doklin: Alright sir. (began to apply slippery slime to entire court, helped with other friend in the role)..

*Sack Hop preparers*: (follow action)..

Firdaus: The slime is as always the thin slippery one, sir. Works like Oil.

Tambel: That's great. Now, what about this one (go to Crackers station)? Alright, (saw the cracker melted) wait. Why's the cracker.. (sniff), (sniff), UGH WHUOK!, alcohol??

Pudong Simanjuntak: Yes sir?

Tambel: (approach Pudong) What is.. (take the hand sanitizer very fast)!! **😠😠😠😠😠.. YOU HAND SANITIZED THOSE CRACKERS?!??!?!?!**

Pudong: Yes sir. This is to ensure COVID-19 dies. We have to sanitize the crackers because there will be alot of people. And it's crowded.

Tambel: The participants gonna eat the fish crackers! THey gonna eat the alcohol with it?!

Pudong: Uh....

Tambel: Now think again. You eat fish cracker.

Pudong: ee yess.

Tambel: You eat hand sanitizer.

Pudong: .... No.

Tambel: Then you should not hand sanitize what you eat, instead your hand, what you use to hold the food. Right?

Pudong: uuhh.. umm oh.. well..

Tambel: (sigh) 🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️.................. Now you get it.

Firdaus: Don't worry, sir (Tambel looked). We have replaced the crackers.

Tambel: (look back to Pudong) 😐😐😐😐😐😐😐😐😐😐... Well, don't worry. We got another jobs for you. For the Pole Climb (saw the prizes have already attached) oh, okay. Great job guys.

Duxi Ster: Thank you, sir.

Tambel: No, don't worry. we still haven't greased it yet. Now, This year.. we use, Thick Slime, right behind you. Why thick slime? because last year, some participant managed to scraped off the grease. idk how, but very obviously worrying, because that being (Jerry the Tumagan) swallowed all of them like a mop fish (ikan sapu-sapu). In addition, to prevent swallowing entire grease ever again, We have added the taste of *Nintendo Switch Cartridge* so if Jerry ever attempted to swallow that again, instead of sweet of the Fructose, it'll be the bitter of no-swallow SD Card. That's right, Denotanium Benzoate, everyone know what's that. So, Grease from the root to the edge end to end, thicc to thicc. Simple as that. Now go!

*Pole Climb Preparer*: (begin)...

Pudong: Okay.. (pick modified 😏📸 thicc slime), (splash towards the prizes)

Tambel: Yess, like that! No slime go to waste. stick as all as you can to the pole and prize! pillow brawl (uses the same pool and placed next to the Pole Climb) is there.. and finally.. (go to Longshoes).. Right, how's it going?

Kondan Diar: Yes sir, we almost finished dipping all these bakiaks with thicc slimes, sir.

Tambel: Great. Okay folks, by 9.00!

*everyone*: Yes, sir!!.

Regon Jeuton: (crane the Pole Climb to its stand).... (ok)! (cover the pole with latex tarp)..

*Pole Climb prepared* + Pudong: (help cover the pole)

Regon: Okay good. thancc!
