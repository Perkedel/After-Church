# Anti Defamation Dillema

As the Anti Defamation Law has applied, people inside Dasandim protested. Many people chose to abandon Dasandim and return nationality and move to another nationality. But alas, such decision is not a good idea, since out there is more harsher than you are. You will be eaten instead of eat.

## Begin

*people*: REVOKE ANTI DEFAMATION LAW! (repeat)!

Isolatip: Okay, Okay, Calm down. Listen up!

*people*: (stop & listen).

Isolatip: I know you all disappointed here. Me too! heck, even if I tried to revise this, I think this still not worth it. But you see, it's for the best. There has been targeted harrassment campaign that everyday goes up and even worse, and it also happening right here right now. For those who missed this, several decades ago we have started operation to capture and prosecute criminals like this around galaxies, since there has been rampant, case of targeted social and mental attacks. commitends everywhere, all just because some parties disagree. Really, death threats is real & a serious crime. It keeps goings on many counts, so we can't bear hearing this that's why. But alas, even after all this effort, not only we've put danger to lives of our heroes, but made it worse, and drastically add more accelerations both counts & level to these attacks. I wish it works. But now we must accept the shower stones everyday.

*people*: (sad)..

Isolatip: I heard you wanted to leave Dasandim & return to or move nationality somewhere. We have no right to judge, that's okay. However one warning, that.. out there, is harsher. You can win, or lose. *eaten*, instead of *to eat*. Somehow, Dasandim still is the safest even unsafe for harrasser. You are now protected, really. WIth this law on the other side, you'll be always be forgiven, and others also have so. How bad you are, still forgive, provided you are indeed willing to repent from your bad action. But I get it. Now, who stay, raise hand. (raise hand)!

*some*: (raise)

Isolatip: Good. Who leave? (no raise hand).

*some others*: (raise)

Isolatip: Okay...

*those some others*: (immediately go to packed already plane & fly away)...

Isolatip: I just need to warn you, I get it you cannot Harrass, Threats, nor murder anyone anymore,.. But Please, out there is harsher than you think. YOu could be captured and executed, or reharrassed to death again, and again. You cannot play this game anymore! You are always underpowered on this. ... Please, you'll die, if you go. Guys?

*those some others*: (already left)!!....

Isolatip: .... Class dismissed.
