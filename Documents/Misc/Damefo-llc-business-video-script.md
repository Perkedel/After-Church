# Begin
## Intro. Damefo front desk
(camera face the front desk covered up with line ups of Damefo products)... (slowly reverse to show all position)..

Zamefo Toudangson (human CEO): (walk from left of camera to center).... (reached center), Hi. Welcome to Damefo. In Damefo, we build solutions that helps the world build better & safer products. Here, we provide researchers tools to help optimize safety for all users of the products. My name is Zamefo, and this is Damefo. (walk away to right)...

## Test Dummy. Damefo Lounge area
(show some crash test footages)

Zamefo: Over the past few years, we have been testing cars to make sure they are safe to drive. The worst thing that could happen is of course, Crashing. So many have died in the accident. But already, we have the tools to test it, and we know it looks like that and that's where should we fix so that it's not happening again. Is it enough though? How do we fully know? Do we really solve the exact issue down to last bone that way of evaluating just form the outside & partially inside? That's why, with Damefo, not only it's robust, tough, durable, and comes with sizes, Damefo also equipable with lots of sensors, (point at sensor package) all in one package. This, compact & lightweight plug-and-play sensor modules allows researcher to extract datas like sense, touch, pain, and even feeling. Not joking. (point to computer in head) Our Damefo can also emulate feelings in the crash accidents and help even more points of result, making sure not only the user safe, but also less trauma, since you know how to reduce every issue points down to minimum. üëç Amazing right?

## Airbag Jacket. Damefo internal cafe
Zamefo: Everyday in our life, we of course not always on car. We walk outside, doing our outside businesses. And, safety in your car, stays in the car. That's why, (‚úã‚úã down smoothly point airbag jacket) with this jacket.. you can wear anytime, makes sure that your vital part of your body remains protected. Accidents are not only in cars, but also motorcycles, wet floor, and other fall accidents (pull string)!

(dummy fell)!!, (airbag deploys)!!

Zamefo: Hey, infact.. There has been a bullying trends everyday, towards every being that lacks power. Yes, elderly. Not just accidents but also trememendous amounts of bullying which could even murder them, eeugh!! So this, would be essential in the day like this. Combined with safety in the car will maximize safety & even more reduce effect on accident as much as possible. üëç Amazing right?

## Dasandim Safety Test Alliance (Crash test lab). Back lab which is that Dasandim Safety Institution
Zamefo: We don't have many series of products at the moment that **we could show you**, we have ***too many of them*** for various purpose.

JOELwindows7: Psst, that includes.. amusement dummies, yess.

Zamefo: But, We are pleasured to be trusted as a forefront & lead in making the safest product ever. (play Dasandim test footages) Dasandim Safety Institute, tests not only vehicles, but also everyday objects, & various events. We also build & find ideas where accident could happen, how bad it would be, and how do we solve it. Therefore we tell the world how to mitigate those issues down to minimum, by from making the products & let others know how essential, it is (point to QR code linking to [source code repository](https://github.com/Perkedel/After-Church ) to CAD & *patents* folder). üëç Amazing right?

## Conclusion. Back to front desk.
Zamefo: So, that's all for Damefo right now. We don't only maintain & improve our ideas, but also strive for the new points of innovation. Perhaps, ***not only safety***, but also many things. Thancc for your attention, my name is Zamefo, and this.. is Damefo. (wave bye bye)!!

## Presentation finished.
Zamefo: ... and cut! Yess.. haaeh. Damn, what I'm talking about? `Reduce Trauma`? `Emulate Feeling`? Okay, We have it.. ugh, Why I showed that though.. Not sure researcher gonna interested with this, unless yes, there is psychologist... mch! üò¨..., aaaaagh.........

Remu L'Ordeo: Okay sir. It's done, it looks great! Do you want to, do again or..

Zamefo: I think that's all for today. I'm tired.

Remu: Okay, Sending this to editor.. done.

Baoran Liu: Sir? We got guest.

Zamefo: Right at the time! Alright, who's the guest?

Baoran: a business man. From LifeLink Institute (a partner finding & marriage helping organization).

Zamefo: Oh. that guy again. Guess what, want me to marry that employee, isn't it?

Baoran: Honestly, I would say yes.. again.

Zamefo: üòñ(felt annoyed)!!, üòêüò§(wave head left right).....

Baoran: Remember sir, `We Don't Reject Opportunities Even it's Repeat`.

Zamefo: UGH! fine. Give it in.

Baoran: (open mini gate)!

JOELwindows7: The Damefo campus gate is always open, until evening. Well it's evening right now.

Capar Lan D'rio: (get in & go to front desk door)!...

Zamefo: Alright, business behaviour.. Ha-whatever. (turn around quick) Hello! Welcome to Damefo. What can I help you with? We got lines of products. Needs fixing? sure!

Capar: Uuh. Actually.

Zamefo: (deny the same request) So, if you got an issue, You can.. go to one of our help desk (smoothly point to Help Desk glass room) over there and we won't hesitate to assist you.

Capar: (face down worry)..

Zamefo: Alright. Okay. I know what you want. Same isn't it? Bao? (send this telepathy message saying that `no longer accept`) Did I already tell him?

Baoran: Not yet, sir.

Zamefo: Okay. So, Thancc for your request once again. However, due to certain factors in our end, we are unable to accept your request at the moment. We are humbly apologize. As a matter of fact, we require partner submission to be specific and exact in their parameters, desired by the other partner. Due to to its complexity, we unfortunately have to close down our line for *temporary* until we can resolve the issue. Once again, (bow) we humbly apologize. I understand your disappointment, however we no longer have available choice.

JOELwindows7: actually he closes the *line* permanently. He don't want to marry real human as he thinks it's like finding cat in sack & they may be ugly & not sexy. Just look at [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dv9c_Zs5Eds ). This finale scares the poop out of me. No, I'm not 1 staring the story writer despite my utter upset & disappoint, why would I? He's being real. That could happen to everybody, including me! I wish this girl, but everything comes messed up, I forcedly have to move on, üè≥Ô∏è accept it, got random lady who's nobody, not significant at any point yet works, what the peck?! No good ending? **NORMAL ENDING?!??!** It's real life. got Normal Ending?

Capar: ... Brother, Listen. I know, my daughter is not beatiful & not sexy. But for real, you cannot marry a robot.

Tapf Fie: Package!!!

Zamefo: Excuse me, Yes? Raozil?

Raozil Liu: Yes sir?

Zamefo: A package. check its content in package extraction room.

Raozil: (take package) Right away, sir. (go safely examine & open in package room)...

Tapf: It's a sparepart. Your prototype sir.

Zamefo: Oh, is that the cr8888 module?

Tapf: Yes sir. from Dr. Hymatt.

Zamefo: Perfect!! Right at the time. Okay, where were we? Oh that's right. Your daughter, my employee.

Capar: Please. Well, I congratulate your milestone in your research striving for the most realistic wife & husband experience. But you gotta understand, brother. No matter how real, only God can make it perfect & natural.

Zamefo: ... (SIGH)... Right. Just so you know, marriage is not forced. No I mean, Choice to whom.. we want. You get it?

Capar: Brother, listen. Don't be stupid..

Zamefo: Okay, thancc for your talk. *we'll see you again*. Bao?

Baoran: Excuse me sir, Mr. *Dragon* would like to meet you.

Capar: (follow escort) Ah syong!.. (turn head around) Brother! I have to tell you, If you used that module even it's finished that's a violation! It's not different than made up cloning!! (restore head angle)..

Zamefo: (pretend not listen & upset real bad internally) üòí

Baoran: Sir, I suggest that you be careful. Our master has already decided. And he does not trust real being after his terrible days during his high school.

Capar: Oh c'mon, That girl is a bad guy, you know. Likes to brek up in the peak of the game. You guys have to understand, love is not about its look.

Baoran: Ouch, buddy! You told that to master, he gonna blacklist you for good.

Capar: Argh...

Baoran: By the way, how much did you made right now?

Capar: About 5 billion Kivrontz last year. Not much, doesn't matter. Ironically, I couldn't get my own daughter there despite all of this. Weird.

## Lab 27. Dasandim Safety Institute
Baoran: Alright sir, Here's Mr. *Dragon*.

Capar: Heh, I thought I was kicked.

Baoran: `We do not kick customer for simple annoyances`.

Capar: That's great. And you, Mr.. Dragon?

Dol "Dragon" Savan: Yes, this is me.

Capar: Explain to me, what are doing here?

Dragon: We are testing, not safety today, but.. It's a transformator. The idea is that we can reform the looks, down to the DNA. That includes the reproductive seeds too as well

Capar: ... Okay, cool. But that makes them no longer them.

Dragon: I know but.. It's still vague which parameter of a being that defines, the identity. It's more than DNA I suppose. probably spirit inside. Of course. Aand.. the memory, what thing they did in their life, idk.

Capar: Did he know this?

Dragon: No. sssh! don't tell him. I made this in my free time. I've been hearing that you insist marrying our employee, your daughter everyday.

Baoran: We just a new info that he ironically couldn't even find any single potential partner to this day, since it's the time.

Dragon: (shocked, as it has been 20 years after sweet 18) Oooh My God.. hmm.. Okay. Uh, well, I think.. we could..do this. But yeah, we haven't tested this safety yet. Man, I wish (Prof.) Dr. Hymatt was here. He's the expert of forms.

Baoran: And he's very far. Planet I have no idea what's the name of.

Capar: Hymatt?

Dragon: Yeah, Dr. Hymatt Zemivious. Man, he is famous. He can fix beings. Like, plastic surgery but it's better. He can manufacture human skin or whatever he learned. üëç Amazing..

Capar: Uh...

Dragon: Sir, what's going on?

Capar: I don't know, I hate this but..

Dragon: (read the telepathy concern) Well, if we ran out of choice, then unfortunately we got no choice but to.. edit her form.

Capar: ...

Dragon: Not with this though, but to that far planet, right at Dr. Hymatt.

Capar: ... I'm sorry...

Dragon: ... yeah. Dazss... It's okay. But first, we make our master busy.

Baoran: Luckily, we will have Annual Sloantim Expo next month. Our master never missed this one. So, while we're there, we can commission him, and hopefully he do not notice.

Dragon: That should be short also, so we can get her by another day at the expo. I mean, he always stay in that hotel for entire month! Asking everything, inspire everything, etc. etc.

Baoran: Okay, now the question is, do we have interplanet taxi?

Capar: I think I know a guy that can do this. Okay listen, I think we gotta stay low, using Dasandim's Space Taxi gets us known. I must bring you to my cousin.

## Elabro's Mansion.
Elabro Del D'rio: (finished hearing discussion)..... Okay. But I got a little bad news for you. These days, Zevin planet government went rogue so recently. There's lots of types of crackdowns recently. And I am really sorry about your daughter. We'll get her fixed soon.

Capar: Yes, please.

Elabro: We have to be quick, next year, 2023, It's death. Especially Dr. Hymatt business will be permanently has to be hidden or else he gotta get caught.

Dragon: Okay then, let's straight to the battle.

Tina: (stop typing & turn head around) OH YESS?!

Capar: Uh..

Tina: Oh (not the accept husband again), (reset head angle & continue typing)...

Capar: Tina, we gotta be quick. Because we found a guy that can make you looks beautiful & sexy like never.

Capar: .. Oh syong! I'm sorry, did I...

Tina: üòî....

Capar: I have no idea anymore, my dear. We couldn't even get you the one, I've been looking infinite amount of list, billions of Kivrontz, yet I..

Dana Ten D'rio (wife): Papa, there's somebody outside?

Capar: Huh?

Dragon: Hey, people!

Elabro: My cousin! I've calculated the flight that it'll be 3 weeks!

Capar: Whoah, No Time Piece?

Elabro: I forgot to charge them. Uh,, And I forgot to pick them up.

Capar: Syong!!! C'mon, Tina, The planet is going to be evil. But we still have Hymatt.

Tina: ..uh..

Capar: I'm sorry.

Tina: Okay, I'm sorry, God..

Capar: No no, you did not blasphemize Him or Anyone! Go let's go!

Dana: Yeah, GBU too..

## Appartment entry centre.
Elabro: go go go go!! (get in)

*everyone*: (get in)!!

Elabro: (close dome door) Okay, everyone is in? Let's go.. (go to space at normal speed to prevent time dilation because Time Piece that should've been here prevented time dilation when light speeding).

## Sloantim Galactic space area
Elabro: Okay. (type navigation) To the.. Zevin (press confirm). Right. 3 weeks.

Capar: Got a food?

Elabro: Ration. enough for this travel.

Capar: Great. Ah man.

Elabro: I'm sorry, bro. But we have no charger for Time Piece at the moment. This is why. Man, we cannot depend to many to Hat Kid's grandparent planet all the time.

Dragon: Right, If we may know, when will Hymatt gonna be banned?

Elabro: It's rumored to be July, if not mistaken. I'm not sure, but it could be much quicker.

Dragon: Oh peck.

Baoran: (haven't had dinner because no time), (pickup one ration), (open packaging), (consume 1 by one)

Dragon: (pick up also one ration), (consume)!..

Capar: Alright, I think, that is all. Ah.. 3 weeks. Syong. Tina, (point to bed) there is a bed there.
