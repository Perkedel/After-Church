# Cure a PTSD person

This poor boy, once upon a time, were treated like an inconvenient üß©üü¶ person. (Spoiler, the school is the fault. That guy is just stubborn & disattentive just like me, and that's not even a disease at all. We're all different). Now he's adult, and have PTSD with anything medical.

Yes, this is Cardiophilia Homestuck ü©∫ü´Äüíì fanfic!!!

## Intro

### Medic room

Doctor Mervald Sulaiman: (hold srynge draw up), (knock)! ! !, Okey boy. Hold still.

Info: new srynge & new needle. Needle diameter medium size. about .05 mm. there were no thin needle we have now at that time designed to inject vaccines.

Geri Sumarto: (try to run away but can't because he's tied up full all in the chair, sway left right) NOO! NO! NO! NOO!!

Info: Geri is tied up full like BDSM. this chair is used to hold children while being administered injections. School injects kids so their neural state always obeys the superior. That's what they do. All kids from various different mental wirings are considered, inconvenients üß©üü¶. Yeah, like the those people at Autism Speaks üß©üü¶ (the worst ever organisations), thinking those people had to be fixed, a flaw, asperger, diseaseful, etc etc.

Mervald: Easy boy.. (inject left elbow inward improperly that breaks tendons which causes immense pain)...

Geri: (pain) HAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!!!!!!... (blank mind) ....

Mervald: (release tie ups). Okay, Please go to class.

Geri: Yes, sir. (go to class like robot)....

Info: Also all schools there does not teach anything other than how to obey boss at factory, become repetitive workers such as moving one item to another, that's it, until retire and die.

### Class 9A room

Geri: (sitt). (listen like robot)...

Info: all the other kids were also injected & become robot until the school finishes.

## Begin

### Geri's house

Dr. Bravo Andre Anderson: (call Grevor)...

Grevor Sritowi: (pickup) Yeah, Dasandim Technology Alliance?

Bravo: Hey, Grevor? You there?

Grevor: Oh Ahei Bravo, what's up?

Bravo: I need your help. I got a new patient here.

Grevor: Well, what's happening?

Bravo: My patient doesn't want to go here. His parents overwhelmed.

Grevor: Okay where is he now?

Bravo: Still in his house. I am right now in his house. Aaand.. there's a problem. ...

Grevor: (telepathy tracking Bravo's location).... (hang up), (portal to where Bravo is)!, (enter), (close portal). Yes?

Bravo: Heuyiii..... Uh, he's trauma of doctor. It doesn't care if I even wear casual. All person I tried, fail.

Remi Subayo: Hey, sup!

Bravo: Okay just one. He just don't want anyone close to him.

Grevor: Ow man.. this is..... (breath in with nose)..... Hoooookey. Wow, we're stuck.

Bravo: And mind you, he got to be vaccinated. Well already 2 & 1 booster, but now.. he realize if.. look at this (look at the portable anesthesia machine).

Info: A simple portable anesthesia kit. Previous vaccination, Geri had to be anesthesized. Yeah, that much of the fear. Again, he now know the day, and how would go for him.

Bravo: Well this looks already obvious. Can't design that better.

Grevor: Well, that takes time.

Bravo: He left one last booster, left him while everyone's done. There's new update to COVID right now.

Grevor: huh.. Wow. What is it? Okay, I shall try one thing. Hey mister, hey miss. What does he like?

Melinda Sumarto (mom): He likes a person colored gray with orange horn something.

Watoyo Sumarto (dad): I got it in my phone, (open galery), (find that image of his graffiti), (show them)!!

Grevor: (That's Nepeta Leijon graffiti alongside other Alternians graffities) Ooo, wait. You sure?

Watoyo: He wishes to see them one day. I mean, I cannot believe this at all, not to mention they real or not.

Grevor: Okay, stay there. Bravo, can you see why is he fearful? Did you able to seer his mind?

Bravo: No I can't. He's so strong.

Info: Dasandimians pure & given power can block telepathy from other Dasandimians, as ones will. Geri appears to be the strongest blocking.

Grevor: Wow. Definitely need to be relaxed. I think Terezi can help.

Info: Yes, blocking is not the absolute. minds of even strongest block can still be read through by strongest mind reading power.

Bravo: Go ahead, call her! Nepeta too (because that graffiti on the phone is Nepeta, maybe he wants to meet Nepeta)!

Grevor: Of course (call Nepeta & Terezi)..

Terezi Pyrope: (pickup), Y4. WH4T??

Info: Nepeta & Terezi were in Interpol hanging out & awaiting missions.

Grevor: Hey, Terezi. Sorry for disturbing. Can you please come here for a sec? You busy?

Terezi: N44H.. JUST 34T1NG SN4CKS, W4TCHING YouTube..

Grevor: A oke. Uh.. Bring Nepeta too here.

Grevor: Okay so umm.. Bravo, you try again.

Bravo: Alright...

Grevor: Terezi, the patient is in that window there. you watch the trigger.

Terezi: S1PP üëç. (capture patient's mind states)

Grevor: Okay, ready? Go. Bravo.

Bravo: (try enter again).

Watoyo: (follow Bravo hastily) Wwai wai wait. Knock the door first. (knock)! ! ! Geri? Dad's here.

Geri: Is he gone?!

Watoyo: (push door inertially to open it wide) Not yet.

Geri: (Doc Bravo again) WHAAAAAAAAA!!! WHAAAAAAAAAAA!!! WHAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!!

Watoyo: Sorry, (close door again)..!

Grevor: Great. Terezi?

Terezi: Not tru3. H3 1s just.. h3 1s. No m3nt4l d1s34s3. H3's just.. 4fr41d. 4bus3d.

Grevor: (look parent)?!?

Watoyo: (reveal already dried long time ago wounds on left arm)...

Melinda: (also reveal the wound)...

Info: The parents also have been in that school, meaning it was even longer time ago, and no other schools.

Watoyo: We don't know where to go. No place. All schools, have that.

Melinda: The benefit thankfully comes when he was 19, but... it was too late.

Grevor: .. Ow, ouch man.. mch!... Right. He cannot have this. So do you. (test the parent trauma) Nepeta?

Nepeta: `:33` ‚¨ÖÔ∏è (little bit take out stethoscope)..

Watoyo: (async) WHAAA WHAA WHAA WHAA

Melinda: (async) WHAAA AAAAAA AAAA

Grevor: Okay put it back.

Nepeta: `:33` ‚¨ÖÔ∏è (put back stethoscope to pocket).

Grevor: It's just stethoscope. I understand. That doctor is the worst. But that does not mean all doctors are evil demon. Bravo is not. We're.. no, we're not angel, but like angels.

Watoyo: So what do you want?!

Grevor: I hear your son wants to look these people here. Is he really, really really so much?, to see them?

Watoyo: Yes.. He wish.. that he live amongst them, because.. nobody is nice.

Grevor: Okay. Then I shall try this. May I?

Watoyo: ...

Grevor: Look if there is something wrong, I will pay everything. Promise?

Watoyo: ... Okay, there's no other way. (last chance eye to eye gesture) I watch you.

Grevor: Then we shall go. Nepeta?

Nepeta: `:33` ‚¨ÖÔ∏è Okay. (to the door of Geri's room)...

Grevor: Great luck.

Nepeta: `:33` ‚¨ÖÔ∏è (knock)! ! !

Nepeta: `:33` ‚¨ÖÔ∏è (open door & enter)..

Info: Yes, the door is not locked, infact that door lock module is broken.

Geri: (drop knife), You real Nepeta?! What's your real name (real name behind the cosplayer)? You cosplaying?!

Nepeta: `:33` ‚¨ÖÔ∏è No, I am real Nepeta. Nepeta Leijon.

Geri: OAgh.. I must be in Prospit (dreaming) am I? (pinch self)... (pained) ugh.. (disbelieve) No.. You gotta be cosplaying. (take tissue), (try erase permanent marking on whiteboard, not working, OK), Okay, (take hand sanitizer & spray to tissue), (test again & it erases, OK), Hold still, hand!.

Nepeta: `:33` ‚¨ÖÔ∏è Okay. (give right forearm).

Nepeta: `:33` ‚¨ÖÔ∏è Miahahow, slow down (blush)...

Geri: (impressed) Oooh.. ho ho ho hoo.. wow, (lie up Nepeta's hand with the long claw still drawn), whoaaaah.. (slide non-sharp top of the blade underneath like chef slide on the knife non-sharp top)....!!

Nepeta: `:33` ‚¨ÖÔ∏è (undraw right long claw back again)...!

Geri: .. (look Nepeta's face), Wow. I must be..

Nepeta: `:33` ‚¨ÖÔ∏è Awesome!

Geri: No.. cracked (fully stressed).

Nepeta: `:33` ‚¨ÖÔ∏è No, you're awesome, really.

The Car parked there like that in the middle of the pedestrian way to signify `Out of order`, `Maintenance Ongoing`, `Testing`, so pedestrian around will aware and careful with surrounding area.

Yelouk: (bring fuses, toolbox & follow)!

Geri: Okay, lemme check. (look at panel display)..

> Malfunction! Fuse 23.
> DO NOT RUN!

Geri: (the same slot every single time) (sigh)... When you stop blowing up. (turn left key dial to `OFF`)!, (take that key), (insert to bottom lock), (turn to unlock door), (lift buttonful panels up)!! Right.

Terong: (full of exposed & hazardous circuit designs) Heuh, serem amet. Mesti ganti ini.

Info: This panel hasn't been changed since the `Goa Kereta` first time installed & established in 1985. Due to high demand, even in midnight, maintainers had difficulty to schedule massive overhauls & redesign. Leading to this ever occuring problems every 36 months. I said midnight, because Taman Seru opens 24 hours to also accomodates nocturnal beings. Though, usually only automated services like vending machines & many rides opens 24 hours, watched with CCTV.  Manned only services closes by 6 PM, unless there is available nocturnal workers for that service to work for all night to next morning 3 AM. Yeah, there's even space, some beings are too sensitive with ultraviolets, so give them leeway to go back home after the session.

Geri: You're right. This gotta be changed. Okay, (track fuse slot 23rd) 23.... (it's on the top, where the terminal & high voltage cable connects) Ah, (take the blown fuse out)! Okay (examine)... (it's a 25 Amp fuse) 25 Amp. Anybody got 25 Amp?

Yelouk: 25? Okay (find it).... (found) Here 25.

Geri: (pick up), (take new one out), (put new one into the slot), (put blown back to the new box), (give box to Yelouk).

Yelouk: (take & put to discard slot pile)!

Geri: (close like car hood)! (re-lock), (put key back to starter hole top left), (turn on)!

Info: The LCD is pixel monochrome LCD medium size, colored blue.

Geri: Okay, 35 months. Again. Or change. Right, It's good. I'll wait (to ensure that still works properly after the replacing). (lean on the left wall there).

Yelouk: (sit on that available chair by that wall).

Terong: Okay.. (press `declare open`)! Cool?

Geri: (look out to cave mouth)...

(A bunch of Alternian kids from various blood colors hordes to this `Goa Kereta`)!!!

Geri: üò≤üò≤üò≤üò≤üò≤?!??!

Terong: Whoaow, hati2 nak! Jangan lari!! (hands on the panel)

*Alternian Kindergarten students*: (occupy slots with excitement noise)!!!

Master Hedi Shong: (tired to run) PAK BENTAR!! HH, oh my God..

Terong: Okay, tenang aja pak. Kita tunggu.

Hedi: (get to the most back car which is guardian slots) HH.. HH.. HH... Haduh, Baru tahu mereka cepet banget, gila.. (sitt) AAaahdeh.... hoof..

Terong: Sudah siap?

Hedi: Ya ‚òùÔ∏è.., (hard breathing)...

Terong: Okeee pegangan yang kuaat!! (press `start`)!

*Students*: YEEEY!! NAIK KERETA API, TUUT TUUT TUUUUUT, (about to leave point) SIIIAPA HENDAK TURUN.. . KE BANDUUUUNG, SURABAYAAA...

Yelouk: Wow. Looks like we're done here. Sir?

Geri: (remembered yesterday & gaze ponder mesmerizing) üòêüòêüòêüòêüòêüòê..

Yelouk: (pat) sir!

Geri: (realize) HEOHOH!! Oeuh.. sorry.

Yelouk: What's happening?

Geri: The kids.

Yelouk: (looking)..

Geri: Looks like 2 women I just met yesterday. Counselors.

Yelouk: I see. We just got an influx of visitor, apparently new beings are Alternians this week.

Geri: Oh wow. They are real.

Yelouk: You just saw them (never been before)?

Geri: Yeah, the first time. I was thinking it was a hoax.

Yelouk: Well looks like not anymore. More friends the better.

Geri: (finish reading), Oh my God. Even promoted so much. I don't think something you would do in a law enforcement, basically..

Yelouk: Well you know this city is. The most saddest city here in Dasandim. Of course, something gotta be here around to cheer those citizens here up.

Geri: Yeah. But don't know how long it won't be safe, coz.. everyone's looking after you (talking the Alternians).

Yelouk: Oh well, nobody judge the cheerers of the Sorrow. Ever.

Geri: Got it.

Query Sandros: Hey! would you like to come in?

Geri: Huh? me?

Query: (telepathy scanned name quick) & Yelouk too!

Geri: Uh..

Query: C'mon! just come in! it's fun inside! We got games!

Geri: Oh.. okay, thanks.. (come in)..

Yelouk: Good idea. I just remembered everything in this city lets you in.

### Reception room

Query: Ahei, gamers. Welcome. Take tour, or take a look around?

Geri: Alright, straight to the point. You put that giant single page brochure with stander there to promote personils in here? Isn't this unsafe?

Query: üòÄ Don't worry, This city is very safe, nobody dare to make sad further. So safe, We do this. Because of course, everyone in here is sad. We gotta cheer them up! And as you can see, they are once upon a time fighting for their world, & seen by trillions of gamers across the galaxies. Now they're here, it's reall..

Geri: Okay, I see. [Homestuck](https://homestuck.com). yeah?

Query: Heumm!! yeah! Right now they are hanging out. You're lucky! coz last week there's alot of cases recently.

Geri: Alright. Before they go again, can I see them?

Query: Of course why not? That's what you're waiting for. C'mon, I'll show you. (point to stair by the glass door they just entered) Up this floor. (escort to the second work room floor)

Geri: Alright (follow)..

Yelouk: (follow)..

## Second floor Work room

Info: Which is just a carpet floor, full of beanie sofas & those Alternians.

Query: (open glass door of this work room) Ahei, everyone! We got visitors!

Karkat Vantas: WHO ARE THEY?

Query: It's Geri & Yelouk! The technician in Taman Seru!

Nepeta: `:33` ‚¨ÖÔ∏è Miau, wait! he's back OwO?!?!

Query: Ooh, you know this guy?

Terezi: We cured his trauma of doctor.

Query: WAAW, WAMAZING.. Well, (give way, open door inward) here they are.

Geri: (enter)..

Nepeta: `:33` ‚¨ÖÔ∏è Geri!! (hug)!!

Geri: Hoh! ... (reply hug a little bit)..

Nepeta: `:33` ‚¨ÖÔ∏è (release), Still remember me?

Geri: 'f course, Nepeta. (look others), Okay, (point correctly) Vriska..

Vriska: Hello!

Geri: Terezi..

Terezi: SUP?

Geri: Karkat..

Karkat: YEAH!!

Geri: Tavros, Wow, your horn is really **BIG** in person.

Tavros Nitram: (swipe cutely his horns) üòÑ hEHE..

Geri: Aradia.

Aradia: hi üòäüëãüëãüëãüëã..

Geri: aand Gamzee, yeah..

Gamzee Makara: hOnK hOnk, eHeheHe!!..

Geri: Kanaya..

Kanaya Maryam: üòò‚úã, (blow the kiss)!!

Geri: aha, okay.. Feferi?

Feferi Peixes: Glub glub glub gluuub!! üòÑ AHAHAa..

Geri: Yeah. Sollux?

Sollux Captor: yeu.

Geri: Eridan.

Eridan Ampora: yo ‚úåÔ∏è..

Geri: Equius.

Equius: üëç, (back to phone, gaming)..

Geri: Oh wow. Everybody is here.. wait no, where's the human?

Query: Oh, üëà behind there, watching TV.

Geri: (go to other partition) Where? Oh.

Info: All humans here. John, Rose, Dave, Jade, except parents both humans & Alternians weren't here. Note Joel have already merged scratches & retcons as all as possible into just 1.

Geri: Okay. Wow, I'm tired saying of them. I think I memorized them too..

Query: Sure you do, big fan!

Geri: Thanks.. but not think so. Haven't read all. they're just alot. I am confused where was I.

Query: That's okay, most fans like you don't read entire either, not to mention its sequel even all freed up. And by so, they're just.. really confusing. You're good already. (impressed by his superior name & face binding memorizations ability) Fascinating in fact.

Geri: Ah okeh. Thanks.

Info: Ah yeah, sometime the irony we have already shown above. He was trauma with medical stuffs, yet shows no fear & huge bravery amongst harmful risky electronics & weaponries.

Geri: So.. What you guys do here? And basically what this interpol do here? I saw it's galactic, how do you do your mission?

Query: Well, what we do here, and what basically interpols do here is to collect database, of evil people. And when that evil person spotted, usually that local law enforcement on that planet, OR.. the people of that planet tells police or us directly. Now then, we work together with that local police. We help them capture bad guys. as simple as that. And these people you know here, have special abilities that can help polices across galaxies do their missions.

Geri: Okay, very cool! Is there any time when to graduate?

Query: Of course, we recommend in 5 years. If you want to continue, that's okay, but uh.. We strongly recommend you retire after that 5 you're in. Coz you know, this job is stressful. Not easy life. I mean, there's a better things to do than capturing everyone bad around here.

Geri: Well if I may ask, Why these? And why Interpol? I mean we never had any intention to capture random mafias before, what's now & what makes you now?

Info: Query is cheerful guy. speak like circus news hoster.

Query: Well.. that's a good question. You see, (look to window to the entry front door), Days is only just evil and good. It looks simple. The evil takes lives of good. We fought & good prevails. Evils are often times physical, like they.. take lands, do bad things, ransack places, we gotta kick them out of here. Very simple.

Geri: Okay, right. What happen?

Query: Nowadays, evils are getting stronger. We have technologies.

Geri: Aheum. Technologies.

Query: Amongs who hold them, are evils. I heard most of the time couple weeks, is an opinion, that.. they disagree.

Geri: ü§®...

Query: They fought for that.

Geri: Okay, simple. fight over it.

Query: Not just that (sadd).

Geri: Oh, I knew it.

Query: That's right. They did worse. ... They make lifes of whom into such opinions... miserable. suffered, til they..

Geri: Okay, no need to say that. I already know that.

Query: Yeah, you see that.

Geri: And so you built this, to catch them physically? that's a challenge!

Query: I know. But this was Kaorfa's idea.

Geri: Wait, Joel?

Query: Yeah. He ordered Arn, the Saorfa to assemble these Alternians. Kaorfa wanted to show that these Alternians can have redemption if they did so many bad things complicatedly. And why physically you ask?

Geri: Tell me.

Query: See, ban hammer isn't enough. One perma-ban, no matter how hard we try to prevent that person to ever come into the place again, they just.. kept popping up. It's impossible. and not to mention that today there are so many harrassers like this.

Geri: Oh.. I get it.

Query: By catching them physically, we should be able to reduce numbers of criminals who cyberbully innocents everyday, to the point, it's no longer worth coz who defends now would be more than the criminals.

Geri: Cool. But that's hard.

Query: We still have long days to go. But I really believe, This should prevail. Good will once again, prevail.

Joel: Ugh, I don't think that's gonna work right? Well at least I tried. Idk how to reduce harrasser anymore, coz looks like the number did not decrease here.. Time will tell..

Geri: Oh.. okay. Say if works, what this will do?

Query: We'll museum this place! I mean, nobody is interested going out just to capture dangerous people out there. We'll leave few other interpols across sloantim to catch general criminals.

Geri: That's good. Say if fail, what you will do?

Query: ... I hope I don't have to do this. Yes, still museum this place. But of course..

Geri: Yeah..

(scary music)

Query: There will be `strict mode`. entire planet. Our live has to suffer and drown under strict restrictions, just to defend us from invaders that retaliates for the harrasser we helped polices captured.

Info: Query is talking about that **Anti-Defamation** law which will restrict entire Dasandimians from violating rules in the new bill.

Geri: Wow. Hope that not happen..

(scary music stopping, fade)

Query: Time will tell. (back to cheer slowly) But now, Enjoy life!! hehe! We got still have alot to do. During this about enormous amount of time, I want you all to.. benefit the best & most maximum of our life, while still we can.

Geri: Yeah of course. live your best! yeah..

Query: Okay, that is all. If you need some lunch, go down to basement. We got burgers with pickles too here!

Info: Gamebanana moderator we ask bean but instead got pickles coz looks like they despises us after our *seems childy behaviour*, reference.

Geri: Oh cool! Thanks. Lemme hang out, coz.. yeah.. the.. Never met them before. Hehe!

Query: Right, need me? I'll be in the basement. (leave)

Terezi: H3Y, HOW YOU B33N NOW?

Geri: (sitt on beanie sofa).. Oh very great. I feel better. Thanks guys.

Terezi: (pat pat Geri's shoulder) DON'T M3NT1ON 1T.

Geri: You guys must be tired here, don't ya?

Terezi: W3LL Y34H, BUT 1T'S FUN. Ouw Y344H..

Geri: Heu euh, Heu euh.. (saw a computer) Oh hey, what's that? You waiting mission?

Terezi: Y34H. YOU C4N 4CC3SS TOO, 1F YOU W4NT TO T4K1 4 LOOK AT SOM3BODY.

Gamzee: HeY JuSt DoN't TeLl anyBodY, oKAy?

Geri: Nah, lazy to tell. (access) I want also you to surprise em hehe. Okay, I wonder if that bad guy I know is here, (type `Mervald`)... (enter)! Oh there's one. WAIT, (mood serious) there's one..

Terezi: (stand up)??

Geri: (click)! ... (that's him, Mervald Sulaiman) üò†üò†üò† Oooh.. Son of a b8888.

> Sulaiman, Mervald
> Location: ???
> Crimes: Children mental exploitation (Traumatizes over 4450 students with unethical drug injection in the same school), Unlicensed medical practices, Malpractice & cause permanent disability, illegal scalping of generic Hepatitis series medicines & high priced resellings.

Terezi: W3lp. W3ll, If you s33 h1m, just c4ll us. You c4n us3 3m3rg3ncy pol1c3 lin3 (911) if you want. But 1 r3comm3nd th4t you us3 non-3m3rg3ncy lin3s so to not d1sturb 3m3rg3ncy polic3s 4nd not1fy the 3n3m13s & h1m.

Geri: Right.. I'll tell you like latter.

Terezi: You w4nn4 s4v3 it?

Geri: Sure. (scan NFC with phone), (download)... (saved) Okay. I mean he does not look older doesn't he?

Terezi: H3 4lso sc4lp3d cosm3t1cs too. 3l1x1r on3 esp3c14lly.

Geri: Oh, make sense. Okay, thank you so much.

Yelouk: Sir, we done?

Geri: Hey, wanna lunch here? Their burger had pickles.

Yelouk: oh nice!! Let's go!

Joel: Burger with pickles are sought after in Dasandim. I decided to take positive even though that Gamebanana Moderator which I think took down my ask why Mid Fight Masses (& despised me `üï∂Ô∏è Cool story bro / Over-exagerated crybaby` when I protested on the other thread talking similarly drama of FNF), or other moderator, bla bla bla, that Gamebanana Moderator I ask for `bean`, gave me `pickle` instead when most of them got that `bean`. Like I think he hates me. well peck you and your family then! right?? idk.. what do you think? Gamers, maybe for now we should leave that person alone. I know he's a karen, but our mission here is not to reharrass that guy back. We got better things to do than ranting GameBanana after what another mods done to.. uh.. that Fire Emblem Patch thingy, sorry I cannot link this my reupload here, ask Admiral Zumi, he knows where it is. Yeah, basically it. I also am a victim of harrasment by GameBanana moderators (in my opinion). Weuh, Speaking about this boils my blood 4000 Kelvin. But again, pls keep cool for now, I tried my best too.

(lunch alarm)!!!

Nepeta: `:DD` ‚¨ÖÔ∏è OwO!??! LUNCH TIME!!! (creature style) YIPPEEE!!!
