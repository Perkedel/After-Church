# Trivia Murder Party: Hotelgeddon

Hotelgeddon is basically open source clone of Trivia Murder Party. Hosted by Vriska Serket & no need voice filter unlike usual TMP, because herself is already menacing & scary.

The host can even play as herself too. simply insert Vriska into the player join slot. If only Vriska plays, it will do Bored Mode, like Roleplaying only to herself.
