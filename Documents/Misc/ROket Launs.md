# (Navimbi) Context
Here's the context: https://youtu.be/OJdG8wsU8cw  (4th wall: might not interconnect today)
YesYesterday Friday, A group of gamers who called themselves **T-pose Clan** had successfully launched a brand new home which is a space station for living space that they called **Tyramids**. well, not to be confused with **Unity** however, that's different station, from a Germany gamers clan.

# (Remimbi) Reasons
That's right ladies & gentlemen. As you guys have heard recently regarding the terrible moments here on earth, most prominently **This Pandemic right here**, locks all of them inside home, which sounds still fine to them and they can just play games and everything is normal **BUT** they also have had issues with their neighbor, you know, **those riot thingy?** yeah those ones. No, I mean, it shouldn't have been so violent like that

# (Navimbi) Rocket
YeYeah buddy. that's why they want to escape and also to **keep distance from this terrible planet we live on, on offense.** So as you can see of this footage posted on official T-pose channel here (show footage), here's the view of the station itself. We had read their spec, that it had width of roughly 10 times Africa & Indonesia land combined. That's huge! **really huge!**

# (Remimbi) Advantages
That's right, it's big! and also since as of today earthlings do not govern space, therefore **it is out of juridiction of any nation, than any sea houses** hence there will be no government but T-pose clan themselves. Yeah, away from all governments, sounds like a dream.

# (Navimbi) Jealous
WWow, buddy. I'm so jealous! **I wish I could join them.**

# (Remimbi) Register
Don't worry, pal. Anyone can register your slot there for just **US$ 500k** . Yeah, so luxury at this moment, but hey! I heard they also would like to build another one, is that right?

# (Navimbi) Second one
yeYeah that's right. They'd like to build another one because it is popular, a huge success! **Stonk!** but wait, how about **Health Protocols?**

# (Remimbi) Wear your mask & 37 degree Celcius
Gooood question. Now of course, everybody that came from earth or any planet that notorius for sickness will be scanned right at the vacuum gate. in addition to respect the earthlings down there, they still wear masker in space! especially, **quote on quote "getting outside"** to do something.

# (Navimbi) Wow
wWOw amazing, I would like to join! (rewear mask, end of the news)

# (Remimbi) Go ahead
That's right. Go ahead, you can join now! only for **Five hundred Grands** and the **slot is limited!** So guys and gals, (rewear mask too)

# (Dasan) You didn't know Dasandim exist?!
**Am I a joke to you?**

# (JOELwindows7) What did King Dasan meant?
So, These host here didn't realize that Dasandim do exist.

So a few months ago, on March, there was an event called **Interstellar Rescue Operation** held by Government of Dasandim, in a wake of COVID-19 that medium speed and surely taking down lives on earth.

I forgot a little bit, you should check [Jason Harbour's isolatip](https://open.lbry.com/@JOELwindows7:a/Jason-Isolatip:f?r=HkNnX1Rva9XZqJRcDHD44Vpgn5GgsnnZ ) in my LBRY channel.

Van Elektronische family witnessed many deaths caused by this tiny but harmful this **Coronavirus**. So apparently, John Van Elektronische (Current CEO of Van Elektronische, Father of 25 children, Coatin being the first child) popped remember that he had known someone from Dasandim, it was **Harmony Sinnel**, CEO of Dasandim Space Alliance. 

And at the same time, Jason also called Harmony, as he witnessed the news that many isolatip (note isolatip is floating custom island meant to away from any lands except sea) resident somehow got struck by COVID-19. afraid getting infected as guests come by, he decided to flee with his family, as well as **try again** from his "failed show". There is no choice. stay and die, or ReRisk and probably save lives. Harmony arrived and be like "would you like to try again". Jason then "Yes, we are in". Wife "why?", and Jason "There is no choice.". Yeah basically it.

also, the participant of Jason's 2015 show who had their space ship not destroyed, realized that they could rescue many lives and flee out from the earth. since Harmony thought that the capacity **would not be enough**, he decided to also deploy a lot of **Spaceship Mk. II** to earth and pickup many lives, healthy and sick (separated per condition, but eventually combined because no time to scan) all of them, whoever wished to get out from earth.

and there you go, a day and the night where many humans fled away from earth. They all landed to Dasandim safe. Coronavirus magically taken out, and had their lungs refurbished. yeah.

unfortunately not all earthlings trust aliens. all of them are those who meh Jason in the first place because "aaa, it's too dangerous! what if meteor or alien attack me? bla bla bla" like that.  
So stupid decision. and so sad, that many of them who dissed Jason and refuse Harmony's help died of COVID-19, **because they also ignores Health Protocols**.

Even worse, many karens against Jason spread the post that says "Jason is hoax", "alien is hoax" stuff like that, so many karenifications, the leader of **T-pose clan, Ken Shappofey** whoops distrusted the existence of Dasandim and forget about it. So forget, Ken instead assembled special team and together build space station that is away from any government. Oh tydac, **Ken is a karen's hoax victim!** And now, there it is. A whole new nation. the T-pose Nation. on space. 

great. now you karens screwed this all up, you satisfied? Enjoy your loss of money for US$500K compared to Dasandim which registration only takes US$10 (that cost is only huge area full luxury 3 floor up & 10 floor down house cost, nothing else). You let earthling never enjoy the Paradise of Universal Basic Income which had been long established long before I was born. What do you even want, idiots? you want us all dedd?

let me spoil you this part of timeline. 10 years after T-pose station in operational, they had crisis. Not even farming would help, what concerning here is the vessel body maintenance, and they ran out of metals. Unfortunately, Metal farming seed only found from Dasandim. as well as other materials. And yet so, in space, the effective plants to farm are mostly foods. See? this proves you karens are **pecking idiots**. Congratulations you destroyed humanity! I salute with you guys (sarcasm)!

ok anyway, the vaccine is under clinical trial on earth, also Dasandim, and it's getting close to done in months. Yeah, why Dasandim make vaccines too? because extraction magic power takes efforts. it's tiring, considering they've just rescued 6 billion humans (in Perkedel Cinematic Universe, there are more humans than IRL, due to me had forked alot of franchises) which between them, there are 50000s of them were COVID-19. Wow you keep doing this extraction, done your age, you are too tired.

so yeah. basically it. It's sad, the T-pose didn't know Dasandim actually exist in this Cinematic Universe and instead built the rocket their own without guaranteeing that they could sustain this forever.
