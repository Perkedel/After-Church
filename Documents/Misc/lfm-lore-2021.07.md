## Wakturia, Dasandim. 2021
Grevor Sritowi: Okeh, here it is. Hookx, is there a movement?

Hookx: (at Amfrost hill) Yes sir, there is no movement today.

Neshim M'neer: Okay, bad. Right, we should, oh wait there they come!

Grevor: Alright, let's watch! Music is ready?

Neshim: ready.

*(Gyouter passing, go to Effendrim)*

Effendrim Machelan: (working in the console in Mission Control Center)... That arrow looks beautiful to me.

![SAUBO note sprite sheet](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Perkedel/Kaded-fnf-mods/stable/assets/shared/images/Saubo_NOTE_assets.png )

Gyouter Embinosa: Yeah indeed. that's beautiful. btw, what's the name of those arrows?

Effendrim: Hold on, let me check (analyzing asset)... (found name) Okay, it's `Saubo`.

Gyouter: (Suprised & feared) Wait, excuse me?

Effendrim: it's *saubo*, sir. uh, idk why the... peck is... ***saubo***??? (further analyzing other parameters)..

Gyouter: Right, this is bad idea. If they found out this our contract process could be jeopardized. Can you please find who is responsible implementing this?

Effendrim: (change of direction) okeh, uh.. (check surrounding facilities).... (found somebody using LoreCaster at LoreData interface to force implement *radioactive* story element) sir, somebody is attempting to force converting other story into here.., at the LoreData interface

Gyouter: Oh no! see you later! (quickly depart & go to LoreData interface)

Effendrim: Sir? ... okeh.

## LoreData interface, Dasandim
Gyouter: (go to parking hastily)...! (turn off car), (get out car), (go enter the gate).. (gate open and go to scene)!

Latsufir Umnaga: Alright, hmm wow impressive. Kaorfa likes MIDI you know, so yeah let's bring [this](https://gamebanana.com/mods/43569 ) in out shall we? (successfully yoinked) Woop! Yeah!!! alright, for experimental..

Gyouter: Latsufir?

Latsufir: HUh? oh hey sir? how've you been?

Gyouter: How many stuff have you been yoinked?

Latsufir: uh... I, hold on.. 1, ...

Gyouter: Remember, we are not allowed to pull one subrealm here, because that already sealed and radioactive.

Latsufir: Yes, I know. I just got the MIDI, 4'33", and the.. (hold Saubo arrows) this thing right here, wait a second how does..?

Gyouter: (point at Saubo arrow) Latsufir, put that down.

Latsufir: no no! it wasn't me!! I was just...

Gyouter: really, who is it then?

Latsufir: It just come by itself, even before I came.

Gyouter: (stare while reading Latsufir's mind).... (bewildered because indeed Latsufir is not pulling Saubo) what?

Latsufir: see, I told you.

Gyouter: (look at the CCTV camera right up by him and read its mind remotely)... (even more bewildered because the footage corroborates so).. Uh.., (go to the console of that LoreData interface)... (read yoink list)... (found Saubo was LoreCasted by Kaorfa JOELwindows7 himself) Kaorfa what the heck?

Latsufir: I am not sure man. He is usually careful with his decision, but maybe this too. Perhaps it's the reason why LoreCaster, Kaorfa seems flexing his technology over here, maybe he's extremely saddened and shocked by that subrealm happening.

Gyouter: blue... Hmmm, I got a thinking. You know why when you press down on Hookx it goes black?

Latsufir: aaaa yes. it's..

Gyouter: don't tell me. you already know that. Right, so, these all we get?

Latsufir: yep. there's more in the list that aren't yoinked yet. And Kaorfa is still looking for more.

Gyouter: Okay then let's bring this home, Grevor gonna love this. (saw Grevor right at a time)... Grevor?

Grevor Sritowi: (severly scared) ... uh.. sir..

Gyouter: what's going on?

Grevor: .. 2 again. now 3 subrealms

Gyouter: Oh my God. what?

Grevor: you have to see this.

Gyouter: Okay, right away.

Grevor: I'll take these to my car. we gotta go!

Jammerfield Fashener: Bunch of reserved for radioactive in the [dataset](https://github.com/Perkedel/Kaded-fnf-mods/tree/stable/assets/preload/data ). oh no! Kaorfa is in wrath and ragequited, I repeat, **Kaorfa is in wrath and ragequited!!** (saw one of dataset folder), it's empty though..

Grevor: (entered the command room) Right, everybody. what's going on here?!

Effendim: Sir!!! you have to see this!!! 2 another subrealms have been sealed off!!!

![copiar noteskin](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Perkedel/Kaded-fnf-mods/sammer-woost/assets/shared/images/Copiar_NOTE_assets.png )

Grevor: what the?

Latsufir: uh, (lift LoreCaster to show them that) LoreCaster is in my hand, I took it off already.

Effendim: Sir, correction, it was... Kaorfa that bring those in. including that one.

Grevor: (felt even more doomed as Kaorfa JOELwindows7 gets angrier even more)

Effendim: He is likely and sure will make another one to cover that one up for cope. It's already 3 of them now. Sir, do you want..

Grevor: **YES!!** ... Operation Downtake. We are in war.

Effendim: Okay, I will report our military division right now.

Grevor: YES pls! (camera close to Grevor) (Grevor terminally is shocked badly)...

Effendim: Okay, I've sent it, oh the military already knew this okeh. They'll.. they'll go. It's deployed.

Grevor: What condition that triggers contract failed by takedown?

Effendim: pls wait (checking contract conditions)... When the `Full Ass` is canceled with the reasons that's it. And special decisions, though it won't be trashed or privated no matter what.

Grevor: oh man.
