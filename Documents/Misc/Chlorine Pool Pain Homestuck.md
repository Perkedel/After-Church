# Chlorine Pool Pain

Gag moment Family Guy inspired

## Begin

Chris Ziil: (come out of water out of breath) HHH!!! UGH! Sir, pls stop!

Coach Masset Saryat: (also come out water in cool style).. Really?

Chris: Why the hell I joined this club then, I thought we're mostly doing billiards.

Masset: Well, billiards has died the moment you submitted, don't you remember?

## Cutaway Submission review

Mr. Deuk Gal: Opp, There's one guy, but we killed Billiard! What do we do?

Mrs. Liem Hon: Just throw him to *pool*!

(Badum tss)

Deuk: **GREAT IDEA!**

## Cutaway finish

Chris: Friking crabs, I wish the school let me resign outta here. You gotta help me out!

Masset: I would, but I am also not allowed to. Listen. I suggest you stop complaining. You can do this. It would be useful in an event of a drown ships. For example, (point where Feferi last dived) Feferi right there can sleep underwater 8 hours straight no problem..

Feferi Peixes: (Come out in nose pain) GAAHHH!! Argh..

Masset: (Confused why did she out prematurely)??? You just start meditating 30 minutes ago.

Feferi: -EOHOK!!, AH-EM.. HRGRGRGRGRGGRMM!!, Ohok!, Chlorine.

Masset: (async) (look each other to Chris)..??, (look Feferi again)

Chris: (async) (look each other to coach)..??, (look Feferi again)

Masset: Well, oh yeah. But there is no natural simulated pool in our area, how then?

Feferi: ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è...

Chris: Btw, you coughed and your nose turned ** Dark Fuschia** like just inhaled a 16 ml of COVID-19 Flu sample vial. You breathe?

Feferi: Yep.

Chris: Mmmm, no wonder. Not only you ch.. not cheating. Just..

Feferi: It's okay, I cheat. But yeah, that's me.

Chris: ... okey, no problem. Next time don't. People here Chlorinated pools to prevent rottening bacterias. In fact, don't breathe Chlorine.

Feferi: Okay.
