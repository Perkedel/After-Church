You'll answers few questions. I hope you know how to play, but if not, it's just selecting 4 answers. Sometimes it's not always, but they'll tell you each. (lift reached minimum & stop), good luck!

C'mon, LET'S GO!!! 

(begin dis or dat)

Faruk: (wrong) ARGH! it's wrong weapon, they went away.

Faruk: (right) Wow, can't believe this.

Fireball or Iceball, you guess whiich! If you blocked it (correct, projective stops due to temperature difference), extra point! If got hit (incorrect, projectile slips through panel because same temperature), lose point! HAHAHAHAHAAA!!! Here's your magic spell! | (skipped) Ohhh, you even more daring are ya? Go get f8888 off!! And your magic word is..

(minus point player sucked into blackhole of void)

Will-less 1 (right): Hey, somebody coming up

Will-less 2 (middle): That's great!

Will-less 3 (left): welcome.

info: These will-less have their free will taken away, and becomes just like robot, who needs programming. they are punished because did not successfully harrass the victim.

Contro: (lowest score) Okay, now lowest two of you. (point 2 lowest scored player) yes you. You guys are great, but it's an utter mess. (sigh) I think I have a job for you.

(teleport these 2 lowest scored player to desktop computer room)

Contro: (take free will away & program them to do this) You'll do your best to make false & egregious accusations against these oh so otaku artist to the FBI, against your will. You will do this repeatedly together with others until they got falsely punished. and then goes to the next, non-stop. If you're banned, you will make account again and again, and you cannot *will not*.

Contro: (Normal score) And you all except the winner. Very good, but not so much. It's okay, I can have that. Well, I am running out of jobs here. But, I have one that never has maximum. Lemme show you. 

(teleport these normal score player to voodoo shooting conveyor range room)

Contro: (take free will away & program them to do this) You'll stab these voodoo dolls non-stop. Every time you hit them, people these voodoo target will experience immense amount of pain, non-stop, and even bad lucks too. You will never able to say *will not*.

Contro: (Winner) Okay, and my boy!!! or girl, who whatever gender you are. How did you learn yourself to do that? how many people have you murdered? How did you even somehow able to make it impossible to call for help? I have alot of questions. Never seen bullier this mad in my life! Oh well, I guess I gotta have to foster you, coz you got skills & will. And I got a special job for you.

(teleport the winner to VIP room)

Contro: (keep free will intact) Hey, you know, designing plans for the harrassment is hard. It's not that easy, considering help companies are getting smarter, skillful, resourcefull, & quite adept these days. It's a war. You have to kill your enemies, and ours. So, what things comes in your mind? I'll leave you here for you to think. Oh, if you done, you can press this button (go back to menu button). No need to press now, anytime, stay here as long as you want, if that's you're into

info: Only the winner can go back to menu. this is getting most immersive for actuate mechatronic VR, where loser rider limbs will be forced to do these losing jobs, and leaving the winning rider a free movements. Prolonged exposure to forced motion will also cause fatigue & cramps. Yeah, you can do that for days. Maximum 3 hours due to safety law.

### Press Back to Menu

Contro: Whoah, you done? Wow, these designs are impressive!.. well, I am not allowed to jealous, you're my treasure. Also, for your information, you've made them cramp for these time

(Stay Punish Time)

Contro: Hope that made or break a Guiness World Record!

(return to main menu)

### 3 hours reached | Emergency button

Zoblatos: Due to a safety law, the forced motion has been released. | (force release) A player has begged for force motion release, due to safety law, we must obey their request.

(& punishement continues on without forced motion. Punished Players can get off the mechatronic) | (force release) (that player gets freed & can get off the mechatronic)

## Questions

Info: Questions are often biased rather than facts unlike other YDKJ games. Many answers are rather unfair to trap alot of players.

### Phone Brands Bias. Dis or Dat

`Revolutionary` or `Wannabe`?

- Samsung Galaxy (just `Galaxy` in JP). Dis. Samsung Galaxy is the only luxury and highest tech Android smartphone brand, but of course, it's very expensive like Apple.
- Oppo. Dis. Oppo used to have innovations back then, but now is just wannabe.
- Apple. Dat. Apple iPhone was the first smartphone brand to become viral & sets standards of the industry. Now they are so late to the innovations these days compared to Samsung and yet still too expensive & proprietary.
- Xiaomi. Dat. While it's very cheap and decent, Xiaomi does not appear to have significant amount of interesting novelties, although they have other appliances.
- Fairphone. Dis. Fairphone covers wellbeing not just customers (especially, repairability) but also the workers that made it (from the base ingredients to the manufacturings). However, their serving area so teeny tiny & very hard to get outside Europe & US!!
- MITO. Dis. Mito was well known with unique quirks in every phone series, even in their marketing they've invited every viral magicians of that time too to advertise it. But now MITO has been died due to loss upon big smartphone brands & now lives as an appliance brand.
- Nothing. Dat. Nothing Phone (1) only has the light in the back & currently is not customizable. It is not revolutionary either, as there were alot of candybar phones like this too with cool light shows on every ringtones such as Nokia MODEL_PLS.

psst, plot twist. the lift lady is actually the real boss. her husband Controvercius act like he is one due to his skill at making hate speech & directing the most successful case of harrassments. This Jane is the worst karen ever.

And I will make your guess right, because Herukly's daughter is that same Jane, & therefore Yurekly son of Contro & Jane. who's Contro's dad then? guess what? Faruk's dad best friend, Defamatos Galgglaggan!

They're family. idk man.
