Stamp Scare, Pied face machine!

Once upon a time, in a road side in Semarang, beside an unused stadium, accross a hospital. Chincilla Wistonma faces an intrested boy.
Laling Halung: "hai. ðŸ˜ƒ"
Chincilla blushes so red. She has no idea what to say.
Chincilla: "Uhhhh, uhhhh, *short gasp* uuuuuh??? (Finger goes ðŸ‘‰ðŸ‘ˆ out and in)(Heart pounding, moving her left boing boing for 1.1 cm."
Laling: "Oh! I've got something for you, hold on! (Turn torso around, keep leg, search flower in his laptop bag)"

Suddenly Chincilla's dad, Mechanum Wistonma, pulled her away from Laling using his stretch arm grapple.
Mechanum then put Chincilla to a slap pie machine. He locks her feet and push pied her with 3 head-to-bust sized pans of pie. Each has 3 different flavour and colour. He did it and made 3 layers of pied face of her.
Mechanum then released her feet and put Chincilla back, exactly where Chincilla was.
Laling found the flower and going to turn around to default and give his flower to Chincilla. But...
Laling: "(Saw a creepy pie face) WAAAA..(Shitpost explosion sfx)(Chincilla close eye, debris protection reflex)"
He exploded and leave his mask, falling like leave, without even being affected by Laling's explosion force. The flower also exploded and its bits flies everywhere.

Chincilla shrug!

Chincilla licked the pie around her mouth. It's so delicious.
Chincilla: "hmmm! Yummy!"
Then she licked and ate all the pie creams in big maw, and cleaned herself up. She also cleaned her boing boing as well.
