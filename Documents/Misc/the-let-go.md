# The let go of traumatizing & intrackable offenders
Once upon a time, kaorfa was a young boy strolling around school. then an offenders traudosed his part illegally, as for fun. the offender becomes untrackable. it's done. Kaorfa now is trauma.

But the world is too big, and too static to not reset one day. If otherwise Kaorfa dedicate his life to find the offender, he would die. becomes ghost. fly around town to universe, only to satisfy his revenge.

That, would be a terribly cliche film ingredients. Attracts alot of horror fans, like kaorfa a circus clown, played his scares & murders plays to perfection.

Because of this, kaorfa finally let go of the incident and move on, forget them, and start new businesses. Kaorfa has declared absolute reason, that the world are too big to think for just one trouble.

# The reupload
You have seen the trauma amongst this community here. The original creator made mistake, got fallen into wars, and surrender, trauma all over the world, beg for all citizen to forget her/his & her/his creation. Instructed all Guards in the Monkeys to banish all creativity related to her/his creation. Transfer the creation over to another owner, but still don't grant the reallowance upon the creation.

If nobody agree, it's like to dedicate for find for offender. the moment would die. becomes ghost. fly around town to universe, only to satisfy its revenge.

That, would be a terribly cliche film ingredients. Attracts alot of horror & loss fans, like becomes a circus clown, played its removal & gaslights plays to perfection.

Because of this, the `Last Funkin Moments` born, to eventually send message to all gamers. We all have trauma, being offended, etc. etc. But the world is too big to dedicate or cease our life just because of one or two issues. Don't waste your life, none shall be waster, just because of an issue. Use them, as all as you can. retake the creation you've thrown, reuse, and tell the world,

**Peck you.**

# I wish I become the boss of that subrealm eventually.
too big wish, I know. I could just use LBRY Odysee, or any other that does not have specifically strict moderation per category. but the subrealm of the Monkey becomes unreliable as the people who runs that subrealm sticks to this trauma. Who's gonna guard this subrealm, when everybody's gone?
