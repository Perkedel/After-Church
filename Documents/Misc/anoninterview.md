# AnonInterview

Interview anonymously, or not if both or all wants.

Chat with stranger, or have survey with stranger, all without meet face or even names. Joins just join.

Want to anonymize your name so your question can't be tracked? No problem. Or want your name be known? Also no problem. No account needed. Just remember the password for each file, in case you wanna edit, review answers, or delete.

Very privacy! We have 7 data processing server, one for each day cold reboot. In every next day, that server will be turned off & then turned on again. All data processed goes to RAM & no server has storage. Just ROM, RAM, CPU, and Network. No harddisk, no SSD, no private data stored, ever. How about the answers then? We'll email them. But we want it shown! No problem, that answers can be immediately sent to question data store server after interview session for others to see (not recommended, especially sensitive questions).  
The question data store server never store private user data, only that question & answers. Answerer can store name if they want.
