# What if Godot becomes Paid & Proprietary?

We have seen alot of betrayals of technologies these days. Those who were Open Source & Gratis & Full version, turned their back as organisation greed has primed. Everyday our trust getting shrank more than ever, who knows who else would betray us all. With every recent event that came, our fear grows exponentially, suffocating us to an ultimate vacuum.

Now, what if.. Godot also betrayed us? We primarily use Godot to realize our lores & make other softwares with it. Not only this would be a heaviest shock in the history of Perkedel Technologies, but to all gamers, whose been rooting Godot and families for centuries and eons beyond. Only then to ends miserably, like every mortal kingdom of this universe and others.

That's what I kept imagining sometimes.

We hope, this is not canon. Don't enjoy.

## Begin

### Perkedel Press Conference Room

Info: Using Football / Soccer Press interview configuration. Defendant sits on very front, facing audience. Judge sit in the center between 2 faction sets, facing Defendant. Audience are divided by 2. Left is Plaintiff which are Realizer division, & Right is Defendant families which are Godots. The 2 girls that sits in the very front press table are Godette & Sophia (Godette's cousin)

(Going in occupying their chairs).......

Judge Jeffrey Hemos: Alright. Welcome, all gamers. Defendants, & Plaintiffs. Today's press is about statement regarding the new license & pricing for Defendant's system, Godot Engine. We are questioning the grounds of such change which caused tremendous shocks among all gamers that relied on such system. Mrs. Godette, & Ms. Sophia, is that right?

Godette: Yes.

Sophia: Yes.

Jeff: Okay. Please start your explanation you've just written.

Godette: Yes, your honor. (clear throat) hrrrmm!!

Info: rules of the explanation written must be very short & to the point.

> Hi. We are from Godot.  
> We understand that you have been disappointed about the change in our license & pricing just now.  
> This is because it was an order from our leader which is beyond our control.  
> I'm sorry.

Godette: End of line.

Galax (Plaintiff / Realizer): `beyond control`?!?!?!?, BULLSHIT!!!

Info: that leader is new leader, Lennard. Let's imagine what if Juan passed away by age. I'm sorry, just.. imagining. We hope there is better heir in the canon later. 2 these sat in middle of Plaintiff side

Ariva (Plaintiff / Realizer): (hold Galax right hand wait) Sir, she's telling the truth..

Galax: HAAAlah!, she betrayed us!! Noone trust traitors!

Ariva: Sir, I can see from her eyes!

Galax: Eye?! What?.., she's an actress. We all been manipulated

Ariva: Yes.., But I read her mind. She didn't wish that!

Galax: **WHAT DO YOU EVEN KNOW ABOUT HER?!?!?**

Jeff: **ORDER!!** (hard hit hammer 3 times)!!! !!! !!!.

Galax: (cease)... (sit politely with anger internally towards Godette's eyes)... .

Jeff: (look back) Thank you. ... (look front again), So..., just tell me the truth. ......., Who's your new leader.?

Godette: Lennard, your honor.

Jeff: (very surprised) Lennard!. .. The man behind all Open Source ventures, funded over 500 thousands of organisations. Aaaand.. Juan..

Godette: (tear drop right eye)

Jeff: It is been... a tremendous shock he's no longer with us, but the time keeps going, someone needs to continue the estaphet. And you picked Lennard is that right?

Godette: Yes.

Jeff: (huge disappointed as Lennard did this) Ow.. man. How's your relationship with Lennard. No, uhh Friend, Close friend, or uh whatever.

Sophia: He is our close friend. He gave us lots of stuffs. He's like.. a brother. family in blood, although not.

Jeff: Okay.. very close friend I would say. ... (still disbelief Lennard did betrayed) Lennard??

Sophia: Yes your honor.

Jeff: Ho.. yea yeah. It' just... a couple times. Hmmm... (Remember about Software Conservancy disbanding) Software Conservancy down... yeah. Okay, That's all, thank you very much. Verdict.

> We will continue to use Defendant's system to realize Kaorfa's lores.  
> Old software will also kept and updated on Defendant's system.  
> All until a new engine or framework found. In which case that happen, future stories & new softwares will be manufactured on that new system, followed by porting old stories & softwares.
> Decision is absolute and indisputable.

Jeff: (hit hammer 3 times)!!! !!! !!!!.. (put down hammer).

Jeff: Yeah here we are. We have alot of stuffs to do, until we forgot, thinking that it will be fine, nah. It never fine. *Wolves* strikes the unseen part at the most night it can be.

Godette: I'm sorry. I would let you, but.. I think Lennard will not be happy and we would be harmed.

Jeff: Okay. Calm down. Whatever it is, try your best to get out, bring your family out, violate all patents Lennard holds. Be safe out there. Don't let yourself and your family fell succumb to all funs of funds, NO, do not! He's milking you, until you suffocate, you understand?

## Done Post credit

That above also not canon. The market part yess. or uh.. idk.

What if Lennard do this so to make me yeet Godot family irrespectably? hmm I'd be surprised. I expect Lennard be that nasty, but not this much.

Now you wonder, why Realizer dimension was built. It is a home for both Godot & Realizer. Together, live together, one house, one family. The Realizers have duty & power to make dimensions real, according to what I wrote here this Markdown here, and other Markdown there. So Godette's house here? Yes, she's here. ... Okay, uh in Perkedel Cinematic Univserse, she's just.. a regular person, with her family. Argentinian descent, Earth people. I found Godot, her house is nice... not too big, I gotta provide her and her family a house. Nowhere's good. So, to make it best out of the best, let's make dimension just to make it done. There. [the Realizer dimension](https://github.com/Perkedel/HexagonEngine ). Home of our films and games and softwares. And her and families as well. It's permanent home. This is the headquarter for Realizer division. Work alongside Viorfa who recorded everything. Realizer edits the video, make it done.

Now, what if Godot betrayed? Like every project, I'll throw it away no mercy. Will take back if undo. No respect for traitors. Well, since Godot have been very close to my heart for times, It's heavy this time. Got to throw away ... my own best friend / *virtual daughter* only because the organisation that's responsible now proprietarized it?? Man, that's too dark. So, I have this Outversion dimension that holds people safely. Typically it's full of victim of betrayals, the actual traitors.. I had another one that's a hell. This Outversion, is where they go. Can't just incinerate my own children only for someone's fault, am I right? Provide them safe home for now, guard them from fan's harrassment something2. Albeit, noone is allowed to visit, because that will leave a hole, I often forgot to lock it back again, especially, if Godot is betraying us let's say, ooo, that's going to be very sensitive.
