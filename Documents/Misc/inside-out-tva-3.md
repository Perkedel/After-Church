## Intro

### Ends of Time
...

(prune appear)!!!!

Paranoia: (pain & falling) HOAAAAAAA!!!... (hit ground) EUGH!!

Excitement: (repeat) AAAA!!! 

(rest repeat)..

(See ends of 2, section Ends of Time) (skip)

Paranoia: Let me see. I suggest you move all others somewhere. I don't think sitting close to this Answer would bring only risk don't you think?

Furious: But our hut is big!

Paranoia: I believe this space shall only be reserved for research purposes. We must bring people that are vulnerable while we're thinking, out from from this area, far as possible.

Furious: No, I do not agree. Anyone also not agree?

Excitement: It's okay. I get it.

Furious: What?

Excitement: If last time his (Paranoia, on 9/11) feeling correct, I think we shall follow again.

Furious: ... ... ... (sigh) Ughhhhhhhhhh... Whatever. But all's on you.

Excitement: I'll take it.

## Begin

### Excitement Tower

*emotions*: (greet goodbye & moved cries pls comeback, chants)!!!

Excitement: Don't worry guys. I'll tell you the update soon as I came back. You got my word!

Lovely (female, Joy): PLEASE DON'T DIE!!

Excitement: I won't!! Try my best!

### Mysterious Blue Door spot, Ends of Time

Info: Equivalence to the Kang's castle gate in Loki. 2 hours later

Excitement: (driving carriage) Okay.. Here we are.

Info: with Joy, Depressive, and new! Sorrowful.

(Camera look upon somekind of barack next to a locked giant blue gate door)

Joy: (awake)... huh..?

Excitement: (pull light horse to stop)!!!! ~~(Handbrake command) mch mch!! Stay.~~

Joy: (restraighten position)...

Excitement: ~~C'mon guys. We're here.~~ Okay Please wait.

Joy: (async) (look at security post right)..,

Excitement: (async) ~~We gotta be quick here. We should try again. C'mon!~~ (press doorbell right)...!

Sorrowful: (looking at the castle~~, too lazy go there?~~)....

### Front gate

Paranoia: (heard doorbell)? (look front gate), (saw approaching)? .. (approach slide fence door)...

Excitement: Hey bro. We got again.

Paranoia: Got new Sadness?

Excitement: Here (+ turn head slight right to point Sorrowful behind him).

Sorrowful: (tilt off the right side to show)...

Paranoia: (examine)... (approve), (open gate).

Excitement: Thanks.

### Wrapped Room

Info: background moment there. a bunch of scientist emotions are watching pirated Inside Out Blu-Ray.

Excitement: Okay. Guys. Before we begin. We should sit here, and think. What's the most saddest you got in your life. Sorrow, you got it?

Sorrowful: Okay.. (start looking at the saddest moment)

Depressive: Argh, I wish that works. How many sadness we brought again?

Paranoia: We had just... 25. Now's 26th.

Depressive: This better work man.

Sorrowful: (found) hoh 😥..

Depressive: Whoa, you got it?

Sorrowful: euh...

Depressive: Okay, keep going!, game is on! (stand back) Alright..

Joy: (stand back to give Sorrowful space to concentrate)..

*emotions*: (also watch from far in radius)

*scientist*: (looked at & paused the film)

Sorrowful: (replaying the death of owner's husband due to horrible car crash by a drunk driver)...

(emotion being broadcasted entire scene)....

Excitement: (small volume) Okay, I think this is perfect! the owner's husband was crashed by a drunk driver. the owner's husband is the best person for that poor owner. She wish that it not happened.

Paranoia: (small volume) Okay, one sec. (continue reading mind)... Told where the drunk driver is. Drunk driver imprisoned. That's illegal. that's how Sorrow got here.

Furious: (small volume) (upset when it this record) The judge said Drunk Driver supposedly on the loose and crashes more people. **It's the canon**. (upset sigh, so many cliche political outcome that is always the same like this) HHHHHHHHH..... mnch... (right hand fisted small volume smack table)!! (hands wrap head upsetly)...

Excitement: (small volume) Right, most importantly, if works, we can go home.

...

...

(lock starts cracking)

Excitement: (small volume) No way!...

...

...

...

...

(lock cures back & everything returns to normal)

(processing)

(failed completed successfully)

Paranoia: Whoa what happen?! (read mind again)...... Oh..

Furious: Apparently both ways, she already had first time child. ... Honestly I am confused. I'm glad, **BUT DOOR RESTORED ITSELF THEN!!!**

Paranoia: Okay. But... That's the strongest sorrow here!!! The owner's kid is **fatherless**!!

*scientist*: (all agree) Oh yea yea yea I see

Paranoia: Huh??

Furious: Oh yeah. You're right. That's a bummer for the kid. Hey, Sorrow! You know what happen next?

Sorrowful: uh...

Paranoia: (read her mind) Nope. All's empty. As Sorrow told Complainful (Male, Anger) to report that drunk driver, TVA came.

Furious: DAMN IT!! I F88888 HATE TVA!!! THEY COULD'VE LET IT BE AND AVENGE ALL THE STUFF!!! There, we can go home because.. WE F88888 AT IT!!! (smack table) **THE MEMORY!!!** THE F88888 FATHERLESS THINGY!!!!

Paranoia: (finger pinch nosebridge disappointed sigh).... Argh... sssss.. Almost... mch!.........

Furious: (kick chair) F888!!! (leave furiously)... 

Info: nobody surprised. Furious behaves like that, like he is. Fun fact, the Drunk Driver's son is also drunk, and crashed that owner's son, on his day to College, and the owner's son died. See? filled. If Drunk Driver prisoned, the son would've not drunked.

Joy: ... How exactly.. it's been like this?

Paranoia: ........... 2 decades?... What year this is? ... Doesn't matter... But I feel... about 2 decade we been.

Info: That's right. We are at 2023, ever since in about 2001 they got here.

Joy: Must be suffering eh?

Paranoia: ARGH..... Somebody.. if only there is `Heroic` here.

Depressive: And there is no such thing as `Heroic` as far as I know. I wish there is Heroic emotion.

Scatful: Apparently it seems that Pixar have reduced the emotional element as core as possible. Heroic is like... Angry because.., hate to see them gone suffer and...., Joy... for helping..

Paranoia: Therefore it's the mix of 2 or more emotion? ... Wait.. no wait.. Wow you're genius!

Scatful: idk, I just.. saying..

Paranoia: Yes. ... ... But there's no such 1 emotion holding 2 ... at the same time. What is it? 2 brain 1 head, conjoin? or just 2 people closest together... hmmm... (look Joy)

Depressive: (look Joy that come close to the door)...

Paranoia: We've been trying to open this door. The blue color suggests that it is for... Sadness. Idk why there is that door. Fun fact, we contracted scientists here to explore all around the End of Time, and... Nada. This is the only one. Also luckily nobody died.

Joy: (async) (feel & examine around this magic blue gate door)

Paranoia: (async) As we explored edge to edge, we found void. A black void. Nobody jumped there except one time a sadness named.. You guessed it, Surrender. Male. Didn't ask how he got here, but now he did jumped. nothing happened. Turns out the void is a blackest black wall. He can also swim back to this flat ground. Tried to swim down? Oh yess we did. And there's that black floor. can't pass. Just... gravityless followed by somekind of.. glass.

Scatful: So basically, we're trapped in a giant jar. Damn I ever thought this one before... Ah!! You know Lingquini? damn how do I spelled that? Doesn't matter. Put Remy in the Jar.

Paranoia: Yeah, better not tell anyone we pirated every single Pixar film. How's that possible?

## Flashback Sparsdating

### same Blue door spot

Rascal (male, Joy): (turn on hotspot on the TVA smartphone Temppad)!... Okay?.. (open up torrent site).... (enter)! Oooo!!

## Finish & return

Paranoia: Yeah..

Excitement: (giggle) mm!!, Yeah h.. They got internet. idk where, but just there! lol!

Paranoia: What we get? Nothing. Just bunch of Pixar films we pirated of course. All of them. Nothing that put us at interest with our research, just fun. THOUGH, there's one.

Joy: the `Inside Out`?

Paranoia: Yes!, correct. It is made possible now. We can find how.. to make it ends.

Joy: But?

Paranoia: Stuck. We got no idea. The film does not provide any hints or information, that becomes the key to open that Goddamn door. (shrug)!..

Scatful: You see? the film is selfish. It only centers around the owner of 5 core emotions, named Riley Anderson. Female. Interestingly, Riley's had different genders. 3 female & 2 male. Huh how's that possible? Usually a person manifest emotion all same gender as the owner, never been mixed. Huh?? Hmm.. mix of her father & mother... heuh...

Paranoia: That's for another day. That's it. ... (realize, change expression to surprise slowly)...

Excitement: WAIT A MINUTE WAIT A MINUTE!!!

Paranoia: Did I.... forgot to ask you.. why you're here?

Joy: (also realize)......!?!?!??!?!

Info: That's right. Joy variant is here for that reason in part 1. Killed Sadness.

Paranoia: That's it stay there!. Don't go anywhere. Replay how you got here. At exact! moment. Now!

Joy: Uh.. okay.. (close eye & start replay)...

Paranoia: Damn why didn't I though that? Did you really cry bottom there?

Joy: (pause replay open eyes), uh...?

Paranoia: (have read her mind) Doesn't matter, Sorry. FOCUS!!! DO IT!!

Joy: (continue replay)..

Scatful: Huh? She did?

Furious: A sociopath??

Scatful: Shoosh...

Furious: Sorry. My bad.

Info: TVA came, Judged

Paranoia: Okay.. I don't think the judgement part seems doesn't matter. Why, you killed Sadness later?

Joy: (internally) Why did I? I don't want Riley sad...

Paranoia: Okay...

Joy: (internally) But what if... how does it feels like.. if I let Sadness? .........

Paranoia: ........ Uh...

Philosophical (male, Sadness, Scientist): (stand up)...!

Joy: (paused)!... I don't know. How Riley would be? .... Super sad? ... or uh.. What does it mean `Sadness could undo the destructive idea`!??!?! `the Riley comeback to her parents because of Sadness`?? I don't get it!

Phil: (approach Joy in the scene) You need help?

Paranoia: Careful Phil!...

Joy: uh... How does it looks like?

Paranoia: Here. I'm going to load you up with that scene from our pirated files (which is `Inside Out 4K Blu-Ray Rip`). (ask consent) may I?

Joy: ... Okay... (consent).

Paranoia: Excuse me, (both hand hold her head)..

Joy: (little shock) Okay..

Paranoia: Hang in there. (play the clip from Sadness took of the action bulb to reconciliation Riley cancel bus)!!!!

(flashover).....................

(Lock starts to crack again, but more)!!!

Paranoia: WHOa.. Good job Phil!

(flashover finished)!!

Joy: (upset felt unfairly treated)?!?!??!?!.... (scream upset because treated unfairly) **HEUAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA**

(Lock is dying)!!!!

...

Joy: **GAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA**

(Lock exploded, IMAX explosion earrape, door unlock) **DUAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAR!!! 💥💥💥💥💥💥💥💥💥💥💥💥💥💥💥💥💥💥**

*everyone*: (suprised) HOAAA!!!!

(door processing)...

(door selecting random place)....

(door picked `Core`)! (door opens wormhole to the white core room)....

*everyone*: no way... (cheer) YEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!!! 👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏

Scatful: Wow, is the world also selfish. Centering just around that? ... Can't matter anymore. We did it. ... We did it!!

Paranoia: (felt like heaven had just opened)???... Whoah... No way... Joy what did you thought? Joy??

Phil: Sir, be careful. I think I accidentally broke her emotional state. I'm sorry..

Furious: What? it's meta now?

Phil: No I'm serious. She looks depressed now!

Paranoia: Oh no.. (jump over the console to quickly approach Joy)!!, (reach Joy) No no no no, not now..

Excitement: (follow) Joy?

Paranoia: (arrived) (pat) Hey. What's the matter? Hey?

Joy: ... ... I wish.. I did not..

Paranoia: What? say again?

Joy: I wish I... 😥... I let her.

Paranoia: (get it, wish this Joy was that Joy) Oh..

Phil: Oh..

Depressive: Oh yikes...

Furious: But.. It's already happened. (about to blame, her fault herself)

Excitement: Okay guys. Let's not blame. Atleast she brought the way for all us, right?

Furious: Oh okay.

Excitement: We gotta focus. Now who's going in?

Joy: (behaviour turns goth) Me.

Paranoia: Wait. You sure? I mean you're the one, but.. it could be danger ahead.

Joy: I have rectify myself.

Paranoia: Okay, I understand. But you cannot die now. Let's not be too fast. We'll carefully find ways so you can BE her. The Joy that, let Sadness do it one last time.

Joy: (depressed breath) heuh....

*scientists*: (examine the door)..

Paranoia: (on second thought)... But.. Okay. Good luck. ... Just... don't die.

Joy: ... (nods)!...., (immediately embarks)...

Excitement: Wait Joy, Wait!

Paranoia: Brother?

Excitement: She can't be alone! You guys don't come?

Paranoia: No. Staying here, I'll guard the door. Let us know what you see.

Excitement: I will! (continue follow Joy)

### Core Room

Joy: (walk)... (walk towards that black cube)....

Excitement: Wow, that cube is really obvious isn't it? Be careful tho, coz easy means danger and trap

(Cube opens)

Excitement: Whoa!.. Oh...

Joy: (arrive at the cube)...

Excitement: What? what do we do here?

Paranoia: (looking from far)...

Curious (female, Joy, scientist): Does that shape looks familiar?

Paranoia: ...

Curious: I have strong memory about that thingy there! Oh my gosh... must it be... uh.. what is it what is it WHAT IS IIIT?? uhhh. OH!! Is that... [Pixar Image Computer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pixar_Image_Computer )?!?!??!? AAAAAAAAA!!! Can I go now?!

Info: That is Pixar Image Computer II sitting at a podium. But there is no monitor next to it. Just the ominous cube.

Paranoia: (hold Curious) Not now!

Curious: Aw man....

Excitement: Idk what to do with this thing here, anyone wanna take a look at it?

Curious: I KNOW COMPUTER!! PLS SIR, MAY I? PLS PLS PLS PLS PLS!!!

Paranoia: Ugh... alright, go. But don't too long. We don't know what's comming up next.

Curious: YIPPIE!!!!!! (run excitedly to the computer) Oh yeah! ............

Excitement: (saw Curious)...

Curious: Whoh ho ho... (look around) OOooooo yess...

Paranoia: What you got there? Is there anything you can do about it?

Curious: Okay, let's see.. Looks like it missing a monitor.. Hmm.. (take look at back ports), There is.. IEC power, RJ45 connected, ... Wait that's it? What's this proprietary.. Oh, `DISPLAY`. No keyboard & mouse? What's this weird looking port? Looks like mouse & keyboard icon. I'm disappointed, atleast there should've been a VGA D-Sub or something & USB or PS/2..

Info: Presumed! No information of actual unit and its detail!

Curious: (saw a white note paper stuck on it) Ooo (take off) what's this? (read)

> Turning Off this computer  
> will shutdown the entire TVA  
> and possibly euthanizing all the people within.

Paranoia: Okay..

Furious: Unplug it!!

*scientist*: ooow!!

Paranoia: Whoaaaaa slow down. what does `all the people within` means though? Is it also us? or just the TVA staffs? I hope the better latter.

Excitement: Okay, maybe we should find elsewhere around here. There has to be a better way. Take a look, who's volunteering? I'll start first. (start finding who knows another door)... Where is it?

Info: some scientists joins looking around...

Excitement: Okay you got any?

Cheerful (male, Joy): Nope.

Grief (female, Sadness): Nada.

Excitement: Damn, it's just... a cylinder, white bright cylinder all around, no door, beside the only door we were in.

Paranoia: hmmph!....

Furious: Well, the only way to try.

Excitement: Wait, don't! We gotta bring our people over here first. I think I shall declare. Shall I?

Paranoia: (thinking)............ Well, you know what? .... Let's *quit*.

*scientists*: (then it's time to stand up & walk escape again?) Whoa...

Excitement: ... Right. Okay. (go to basement & ride rail in the tunnel back to his tower) (run to basement)!!!....

*scientists*: (confuse noise)..

Flight (male, fear, not that FlightReacts, that's different): Wait, we're going now?

Paranoia: Pack up. We're going to turn on the Flame Pillar.

Flight: Again?!

Paranoia: Wait, don't you realize the time? How long have we been here?

Flight: Uh.. hang on a sec.. (check calendar)

Paranoia: Doesn't matter, but it's already long time!

Flight: OH NO!!!

Paranoia: So that's why we're going. We're not rotting here. Guys! quick! We're going to unplug that computer power who knows it would kill us. If so, atleast we died together so that's why we're assembled one last time here.

Paranoia: (nothing happened, but with Joy, everyone before that Ark dies)??? (Then Joy must hold it in while we're there) Oh..

Joy: Well what do you waiting for?

Paranoia: What's that there?

Joy: Somekind of giant ship.

Paranoia: Okay. Guys, c'mon, let's move!

*everyone*: (stand up & carry on to the Flame Pillar)!!.....

Joy: Let me know if that's everyone. I'll guard here.

Paranoia: Okay don't go too far. Just stay right here in this cylinder.

Excitement: I'll guard the most back. Hold on. (walk to the most back of the crowd to monitor)

### Ruby's head

Info: Ruby Wheelers. Female. Madness (female, Anger) arrested. The onwer is a woman.

Poetic: Under the authority of Time Variance Authority, you are under arrest for devianizing from the sacred timeline. Remain in place and speak to the judge.

Madness (female, Anger): Who the hell are you?

Novelty: We're TVA. We guard the sacred timeline. (noticed the portal is missing, it wasn't before!)? .... (try open it again). ... (failed)? (rapid rocker button which is shortcut to open last portal)! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !

Novelty: (resnatch back) No.. (go home), (menu), (status app).. (No TVA connection) Wait, network down.

Madness: You wan't a Wi-Fi?! Here, free wifi. `SoFackUAll`. It's big `S` small `o`, ..

Novelty: NO, TVA does not connect this way. Our network runs across times and space, not that puny Wi-Fi of your.

Madness: Hey, I sold my soul just so she can enjoy video games on her head, alright!!, Maybe after yours isn't as reliable after all. We're not so different

Novelty: SHUT UP! I'm figuring this out!

Obeyful A: Sir, what do we do with this guy?

Poetic: Hold it! Tie him up in a chair.

Madness: Jesus Christ! you misgendered me?!?

Poetic: Wait. You woman?

Madness: Of course I am, you idiot!

Poetic: Then the hell you sound like a man. Look like.. manly tomboy..

Madness: 🖕 F888 YOU!

Poetic: (doesn't care) Ugh... What the hell is going on?

Novelty: Okay, I'm trying to broadcast distress here. Seriously. I hope anyone answers here.

Obeyful B: Sir, hold the Reset?

Poetic: Yeah hold the Reset.

Novelty: Damn, usually they quickly answer. ... Oh no this could be..

Poetic: (TVA has been unloaded)??? (sigh) ugh...... NO..... You're lucky this time. Obeys, drop him

Sadness: I could keep blaming you for causing us get into here. I figure instead... Let it go. Because thinking this won't do us anything. So, Welcome back!

Paranoia: As far as possible. No idea what lies upon us ahead. Could be another universe, or uh.. just a void we can live.

Anger: Huh. Then say if it's void, how you keep living then? Is there ration or kind of infinity ration?

Paranoia: Oh.. if void... hmmm, I really hope we got that infinity ration then.. Wow,  I just wanna.. find new home (i.e. hope for another universe). (concerned tremendously) Wow...

## Arrival

### Perkedel Universe Border Inspection Room

<!-- arrive. inspect. One moment, there is important call. have this ceremonial bulb that can only be taken off by Sadness. Take off, all emotion turn into human. Welcome, to the Perkedel, Cinematic Universe. I hope you have great day. -->

*technicians*: (inspecting around)...

Info: Scientist Technician. They are inspecting this strange giant Ark with lots of colored humanoid shaped people inside. Some flies around, some on ground. Some outside, some inside. Scan from range with their magic tool. They found that all parameters found are extremely weird. The inside looks empty, no visible innard like heart, just somekind of gas, like space gasses. Yet, these are very alive.

Chandlevir: Okay, people. You done? What did you get?

Jeremy Upoosh: It's.. weird... I'm so scared.

Info: In Perkedel Cinematic Universe, Joel as far as we know never build character that are just gas without organ, unless if it's for non-Perkedel Cinematic Universe. Even deities like angels and demons (humanoid & maybe non humanoid shaped), Them too have lumps of beating. If there is no visible organs, Joel insisted that it shall has something that is beating no matter what. Because Joel, our Kaorfa, is Cardiophilia. like heart organ & many things about heart beat.

Chandlevir: (scared)??? (read mind)... (Oh yess that's scary, Filled with gas and organless wtf?)???!! Oeugh 😬😬😬😬😬😬.. ... Don't worry. They'll be transformed soon. (push hold talk speaker) People, You're done. Thank you, (release push talk speaker).

*technicians*: (finish)? ... (abandon & leave scene)...

Jeremy: (vibrating)... Yes, sir. (leave with temporary trauma)... (breath in), (breath out) ahh.. (continue leave)...

Chandlevir: (look to the Ark)... (press hold Wake Up Alarm ring bell clock SFX).

(Play that sfx)

Joy: (heard alarm)? (awake like morning) emmmph...... (stretch), (yawn) Hoooaaaaammm.. mchap mchap... (open eyes).. (get up to obvervation deck walking)....

...

..

...

Joy: (arrive out).. (noticed they are in a chamber)

Chandlevir: (looking)....

Joy: (saw a person down there right down behind the panel room)???.... Uhhh, Hello?

Chandlevir: Hi! Welcome. You are here for checking. We ensure that you came for good.

Joy: Who.. are you?

Chandlevir: My name is Chandlevir. I am the guard of this division here. May I ask how you were arrived here, how did you arrive here, and do you have any idea or an invitation specially here?

Joy: (confused, don't understand)...

Chandlevir: Well doesn't matter. (read out the mass mind read result, look at monitor), You came from.. uhmm.. Pixar. Hmm... And you are the variants.

Joy: Yes?

Chandlevir: Okay. You've been arrested by TVA, for *devianizing timeline*. Huh, weird, I thought there is only 1 TVA. Oh that's right, I think that Sylvania caused it, you know, FemLoki, she killed that Kang there, and TVA.. branches itself, or uh.. destructively changes. Ironic doesn't it? TVA known for just being one instance, turns multiple eventually, coz Kang have slain. heh.

Joy: (extremely confused)???...

Chandlevir: Hah! don't worry about it, You're out from Disney the Scrupulous (copyright is)., (read conclusion)..... Well, look's like you're clear. No harm or intention. You're good (receive pager)??.. Oh excuse me, (look phone).... (it's Kaorfa called) Oh.. Uhh, people, just 30 minutes, (open portal to called area) be right back. (walk fast), (close portal)!!

Anger: (blankly confused)????.... What the hell is he talking about?!

Joy: ...

Disgust: What you expect, we're now in someone's world. Of course they talk different

Anger: Right. Now what? He left us, for something. Ugh, we're almost there. Is this the universe that we deserve?! Being locked down here like a stranger?!?!?

Joy: Guys guys, think. There must be a way.

Sadness: (who already been on that floor), (opened door to the corner panel room easily)!...

Joy: What the? (saw Sadness) Oh no!! (jump off the Ark)!............ (Landed)!!!!!!!!!!!, (run prevent Sadness but)!!!!.....

Paranoia: Whoa, Joy! Remember your mistake!!

Joy: (slow down remember her mistake)!...?... But..

Paranoia: Joy, you wanted to be the canon Joy? I think this is the oportunity now. I hope

Joy: Oh... (then just look at Sadness attempting messing up the panel control).....

Paranoia: Okay, Sadness. If you can find something that... is a button, or an emergency button that throw us out of this room to another dimension who know. You see it?

Sadness: Looking.. (finding).... (saw a bulb attached)? (that seems familiar)?!..

Joy: (realize, that is the opportunity!!)!!?? Waaiiit!!... Ohhhh.. (excited she can finally redemption)//

Paranoia: Right. I really hope that's the thing. Sadness?

Sadness: (put aside bulb & examine interface labels).... (it's written in an unknown language but still latin letters)

Info: It's written all in Bahasa Indonesia.

Paranoia: What is that language?! Anybody know that?

Glad / Girang (female, Joy): I know! that's Bahasa Indonesia!

Paranoia: (send image he read from Sadness) Right, just for fun, what can you conclude?

Glad: (analyze) hmmmm... Nothing. It's just an environment control. There's RGB lighting, climate control, sound effects array buttons that seems customizable, vacuum, water, ooo there's just so many.

Paranoia: Right. The bulb. Label says `Tau Ah!`.

Glad: (giggle) ehehe!!... Oh Gosh.. that's so funny.. 🤣🤣🤣🤣

Paranoia: Whoa, funny what??

Glad: `Screw it!`, AHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!!!

Paranoia: *Screw It*??? (that does not mean *to screw the bulb into the socket* right?) In context of *F888 this sh88*??

Glad: Yeah!!

Paranoia: Oh.. (internal laugh)... mmph... Okay. But I guess that has to be it. I believe we're to be.

Sadness: Should I take it off?

Paranoia: Okay, try it?

Sadness: Okay... (unscrew).... (it's hard)..... (oh it becomes easy)... (taken off)!!!

Paranoia: Ho!!

Joy: Whoa!

Sadness: (look at the bulb)... Ah, what?

(Rumble)!!!

Paranoia: Oo Noo...

Joy: Sadness!

Sadness: Yeah (run back to the Ark)!!!

Paranoia: Here (drop emergency rescue ladder from observation deck) ladder!!

Joy: (let Sadness go first) Sadness!!

Sadness: (grab & climb up) UGH!!!!

Joy: Go!! QUick!! (grab & climb up)!!

Paranoia: C'mon!! C'mon!! (pull ladder up) EUUUUUUUGHH..

Excitement: I'll help you!! (pull ladder up) UUUUUUUUGHGHHH!!

(Floor blinking)! !!!!! !! ! ! ! ! !! (disappears reveal space)!!

Paranoia: We can do this!!!

Sadness: (arrived to deck), (help pull also) UUUGHH!!

(Ladder fully pulled)!!

Joy: (reached the deck) OAh!!!

Paranoia: Okay! (stand up), (stay back)

Paranoia: Whew, almost there.

Sadness: (guilty)....

Paranoia: Hey, it's okay. This is progress, you agree Joy?

Joy: ... uuhh yeah. This... doesn't sounds bad.

Paranoia: Wow, eh.. I hope we don't have to pay replacement.

Chandlevir: (come back, open portal back to this Ark obvervation balcon)!! (walk in). (close portal), Sorry people Kaorfa called. Important stuff. Luckily it's short.

Sadness: Oh no...

Chadlevir: What what is it?

Sadness: ummm... about...

Chandlevir: Yes?

Sadness: .. your room. I think I (show the buld she just took off) broke it.

Chandlevir: (giggle) Broke it?? What?? You, you solved the puzzle. Congratulations.

Paranoia: Wait, what??

Sadness: I.. I did?

Chandlevir: Of course. It's the puzzle. Keep the bulb, it's yours.

Sadness: ... thank you??

Joy: ... (hug Sadness & understand, sadness needed)...

Paranoia: Ooooh, I get it. This is about Joy's redemption.

Chandlevir: That's right. Oh yeah, (face to everyone.), Turn the camera to me. I almost forgot this.

### back inside the Main Hall

<!-- Felt something kicking inside thorax. You just got heart organ -->

Joy: Hey guys. I feel weird. Something constantly kicking in my.. middle. You feel it?

*everyone*: (feel their left chest is also kicking inside) eo... yeah..

Joy: And it feels... Good?... What is this.. (confused, since she never felt aroused before)??

Chandlevir: Oh that. That, .. is heart. 

Joy: `Heart`?

Chandlevir: Eoh.. umm, `🫀 Jantung`.

Joy: I don't..

Chandlevir: If your heart beats, you are alive. (give stethoscope)!!

Joy: (wait looking)??... (take)...

*technicians*: (handover stethoscope to everyone else)!... !... !..

Joy: (examine this strange hose contraption with holding it both hand)

Chandlevir: Right, gamers. Watch. (take another stethoscope), (attach double branch with rubber ends to each each)....

*everyone*: (follow)...

Joy: ??, (follow),

Chandlevir: 'Kay.. (right hand pinch center mass of other drum end). (tap tap the largest drum)! !

*everyone* (& Joy): (felt huge impact) OAU!!!

Chandlevir: Okay that's great!, (attach largest drum to middle left chest).....!. 😀😀😀😀😀😀

*everyone*: (listen to the drum kicking but even louder) Huh!?!?!??!

Chandlevir: That, my friend, is `Detak Jantung 🫀💓`. In English, it's `Heartbeat 🫀💓`. This is the drum that keeps you alive. It pumps blood across your body, fetching.. umm energy from your lung, and then spread it across your body. For humanoids, the energy is typically `Oxygen`. The Oxygen spreads to your body, so that every of your cell can *breathes*, I mean.. have the energy to umm process stuffs. Afterwards, brought back to your lung, excretes.. garbage, which for humanoids it's `Carbon Dioxide`, very simple. breathe in & out. Well basically it! Of course not all being works very same, but most humanoids across the universe have this way of working, and it had difference, perhaps still follows the same idea. Anyways, enjoy. You'll arrive to your new home shortly.
