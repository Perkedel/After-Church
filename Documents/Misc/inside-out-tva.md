# Uh oh, some-emotion devianized themself from the sacred timeline!
That's no good. Mobius won't gonna like this.

# Begin
## Riley Anderson's head
(Riley is on Bus)

Anger: **AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA ü§¨ü§¨ü§¨ü§¨**

Disgust: (wear weld mask), (pick Anger and aim top of his head at a window)..

(window blew)

Disgust: (pull Joy)

Fear: (pull Sadness)

*all but Joy & Sadness*: (speak condition that are right now getting worse)

Joy: (witnessed Riley's POV)...

(The bus had already started)

Disgust: Joy, We have to fix this, Fast!

Joy: Saddness, you got this

Fear, Anger, Disgust: **Sadness?!?!?**

(Yeah you should know, go watch full movie, onto the key Nexus event.)

Sadness: (removal ongoing, about to 90%)

Joy: (draw sword key), (insert key)!

Fear: AAA!

Disgust: ...

Anger: so?

Joy: ... ... Okay, where were we? Oh that's right! Let's make beautiful memories

### The TVA comes
Novelty: (walked into the scene)... (found the variant) There she is.

Poetic: Under the authority of Time Variance Authority, you are under arrest for devianizing from the sacred timeline. Remain in place and speak to the judge.

Joy: Okay, can you please explain yourself?

Poetic: (attach variant collar), You have right to remain silent until the judge allows you. Please hold your speaking for the judge later.

Joy: (attempt to remove collar) Thank you, But I am really busy right now. If you'd like me to.. (failed to remove collar) ugh, watch me in action, go ahead, there's.. (failed again to remove collar) a seat, feel free to take a seat! ... (really failed to remove collar)??? (anyway continue the job).. (press button).. uh.. (attempting to take another interaction of other stuff in panel)...

Poetic: The entire board has been malfunctioned, you could've let Sadness do the job for you. It'll work

Joy: üòê...

Poetic: You need to come with us. (apprehend Joy), boys?

Obeyful A: Yes sir (go hold Joy)

Obeyful B: Yes sir (go hold Joy)

## TVA Judge Room
Lawful: (tidying case files for Joy)... Alright, Joy from Riley Anderson (Joy ID `Riley Anderson`). Can you please explain what reason you decided to scronch Sadness in the middle of the victory?

Joy: Victory? huh? Okay. Firstly, I just want Riley happy, I don't want her to have a sad memories..

Lawful: enough, thank you.

Joy: ...

Poetic: ... (confirmed Judge's next talk about sacred event)

Lawful: as Poetic have had spoken to you that, if you really serious and left Sadness done the work instead, the emotion panel could works again. Only sad based emotion can cancel any destructive decision (that idea bulbs) in one click. What you did, is not correct. Riley will be alone once been arrived in there and must survive, her parents back and so on. Since she has no sadness, it will be no difference than... a *mental illness*. No crying, No sad, no depression, No relieves.

Joy: Okay, how does that even work? I believe she must have many beautiful and amazing memories, not...

Lawful: Okay, okay, that's it. You are wrong. Have you not have any idea the importance of saddness emotion? You see, crying, as described by Knowledgeful here in TVA, thanks.. helps children of the world relieve any stress and discharge + throw away what is called.. `Poison`. That's right, mental poison. So sadness is more like `liver` for the brain. Without the *filter*, the poison will just went away within the *digestion* and it could kill their mental, to `Eik serkat`. Food poisoning, of mental. Shame, that these adults considered it as a weakness indicator which is a mental illness of adults to these days, and that's the summary of sadness.

Joy: Okay, so can I go back?

Lawful: unfortunately, for the safety of the sacred timeline we do not allow further interaction at the timeline. But we have other options for you.

Joy: oh! what is it?? üòÉ

Lawful: (nod left & right to confirm pruning). The decision is absolute and inviolable (indisputable), that you will be sentenced... `PRUNE`.

Joy: *PRUNE*? what is.. (pruned)!! OAAAAAA!!!!

Obeyful A: ... Oh sorry, Did I too exagerated?

## Ends of Mental Time
Joy: (awake).. ugh, oh.. wait,

Exciteful: (riding carriage) Hey, you **finally awake**, that's cool!

Joy: um.. where am I? Am I dead?

Exciteful: No. **But you will be**. Unless you come with us. Btw, we're in the ends of time.

Joy: (scan surround) huh?

(view arround her)
