# Homestuck Eclipse yada yada

Eclipse on Earth was the most exciting moment of all time for that planet. the ex-Sgurbians visited Earth back again for this curiously exciting moment.

for family guy inspired

Yes. We are trying to remove Terezi's trauma with looking at the sun. She got her eyes burned back before when Vriska *manipulated* her into looking at the Alternian sun, and the rest is history. As it turns out, Earth people had invented such incredible filter that allows us to directly see the sun without ever burning our eyes. Of course, it still has limitation. You can only look for few seconds.

Same time during **Mr. Bean Eclipse**! [`Mr Bean Reckless Eclipse.md`](Mr Bean Reckless Eclipse.md ).

## Begin

Gyouter Embinosa: So here's the assembly point here. We're going to witness full eclipse in a moment.

Terezi Pyrope: W41T. ECL1PS3? 4ND WH4T 4R3 THOS3 INSAN3 GUYS DO1NG TH3R3?

Grevor Sritowi: Good question! **They are looking at the sun.** Going to see that the moon is covering the sun, fully.

Terezi: (pause & slowly turn head to Grevor)... **WH444T?!?!?!?!?**

Grevor: No don't worry, you use the filter, their telescopes also already filtered. (show the special filter) This filter here.

Terezi: uhhh..

Grevor: Come, let me show you ours.

Terezi: W41T! (follow)..

Grevor: Ahei, Dasandimians!

Neshim M'neer: Oh, yess! Terezi's here. Ahei!

Terezi: UHH, H1?

Neshim: (continue adjusting) This is Cassegrain Telescope. Compact, but this design allows us to see the furthest unlike traditional ones. ... .. (target locked) Okay people, we've already locked it to the sun. Now, Terezi. If you may..

Terezi: (small pointing the unit) 1s th1s s4f3?..

Tengsing Pusingson: (taping the filter to the front multiple times)!!! !! !!, (completed) 'Kay, Won't going anywhere, Yes, it's safe.

Terezi: (skeptical)....

Tengsing: C'mon, you can do this.. Just to test it, coz the peak gonna be exciting.

Terezi: OH.. PLS GUYS G1V3 M3 'NOTH3R 3Y3S W1LL Y4?

Grevor: Yeah don't worry got *lots of eyes*!, c'mon.

([Hussnasty](https://mspaintadventures.fandom.com/wiki/Hussnasty_Mode ) mode. Due to nature of Godot 3D, it's like B roll cinematic something)

Terezi: (nervously & lack-greasely squakefully put right eye towards the occular lens)... !!.!! !!.. (close eye)!.. UUUUUUUGGGGHHH!!...

(pause Hussnasty & look Grevor torso zoom out level)

Grevor: Open your eyes!!

(continue Hussnasty)

Terezi: (lack-grease-squeakingly open eye)!!!.. AARGH 1M bl1.. Oh, wow..

Grevor: You see that orange circle there? That's the Solar sun. the biggest star, and the closest in this system.

Terezi: (impressed)..

(Hussnasty finished)

Grevor: It's white btw, but the atmosphere here on Earth filtered certain wavelengths, blue especially, which explain why this sky is blue, sun is yellow.. So this is what you're seeing now. Of course, filter reduces that overbright much further.

Terezi: OOOOh.. (async) (stand up away from occular)

Grevor: (async) Okay that's.. Yeah. Of course though, you can't see through that too long. the.. filter still has limitation, or just afraid. But yeah!

Terezi: W3LL, NOT SO B4D 4FT3R4LL..

Grevor: Indeed. you're going have to witness this when it's time.

(2 Hours later)

*observers*: OH OH OH, LOOK! FULL ECLIPSE!!

Terezi: (looking sun through puddle of water)..

Grevor: TEREZI, IT'S TIME!!!

Terezi: HUH?

Grevor: (point to the occular lens) Look, look! 'kay.. (look for other things)!!..

Terezi: (see through the telescope occular), ... wow, Now th3 sun is bl4ck.

Grevor: (back again) Okay.

Terezi: W1th th3 or4ng3 fl4r3s.

Grevor: That's right. (look at LED monitor for a sec), The black circle, is the moon covering it. now what's left is that flares emitted from the sun. And that's, Eclipse.

Terezi: WOW, OK4Y..

(view from overal scene).... (sun view)...

(30 minutes later)

Grevor: (re look once again directly through glasses)... (head down & then remove glasses). Wow, we're so lucky. This eclipse seems to be the longest this year. Hey, Terezi. (async) If you wanna use your glasses and look through go ahead!

Terezi: (async) (turn head to Grevor)

Tengsing: You can do this, Terezi!

Terezi: (head turn to Tengsing)?? umm... (look forward).. 

(**Hussnasty mode again!!!** camera dutch angle right to Terezi from above)

info: Dutch angle is tilt the camera slightly. see [Vox's video](https://youtu.be/SHYfsYQDr6M )

Terezi: (wear glasses & firmly hold, close eye) ok4y... (breath like panik attack) foooh, hhh, hhh, hok3y...,

(dutch angle rightward from right side of Terezi)

Terezi: (lack-grease-squeakingly look up)....

(normal angle look at Terezi's right eye close up)

Terezi: ... (finally open both eyes but slowly)...

(camera switch to Terezi's eye POV, default to right eye)

Terezi: (it's a tinier black cicle with flare)...

Gyouter: Wow, you did it. Congratulations.

(finish Hussnasty, hence dutch mode stop)

Terezi: (panik) (immediately close eyes, head turn away from sun, & release glasses) HO444RGH!! HOOF!! GOSH...

Gyouter: See, it's not that bad, as long you got all the safety behind it

Terezi: (Abjure / Reject hand wave) HUGH, NO MOR3. or mor3?

Gyouter: You've seen long. Take a break.

Terezi: (head rest down)....
