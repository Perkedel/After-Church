# Found more facts
- There is 1 project page did not have file to download
- Some of the project to be deleted are made sense for reason, e.g. due to non-working / non-functional / broken rigs & other elements
- But that does not mean the entirity of such purge made sense either. Some others too are considered outrageous.
- None of the to be deleted projects that were placed on Open3DLab. all are Smutbase & Open3DLab
- Many SFMLab projects listed here are ports from RAW materials such as Blend file that are some even posted from Smutbase
- We discovered familiar people such as banchouforte, wo!256, and guess what, **crute**, **JawSFM**, etc. Yes, that some of the legendary people here in Open3DLab world. ðŸ¤¬ Unbelievable.
- We have seen to be deleted project page again, but the page seems accessible on live. We have not yet tested the download again though.
