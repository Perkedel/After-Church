# Sugar Daddy finally

Finally we officially have reached high enough economical status people called `Sugar Daddy`. Now we can spend on anything we want.

No, we're not gonna spend on cars. We only need 1 that works, and that's one. An Electric Vehicle. Don't underestimate this IONIQ 5, this car was the best we had with decent amount of features, enough for now until there is better one.

What about the rest of the money then? You don't hoard noney.

Well, we're going to donate to children. **Just kidding** we are not Mr. Beast. Instead we're going to spend it all on ourselves foya-foya maximum.

On second thought we should donate to children, but specific.

Children needs help both producer & consumer:
- MIDI
- 3D Model
- Games
- etc.

Here are the children types that need to be covered.

Mind you, that `Children` doesn't specifically means the growth level. What we mean is the people type, that can have both high & low growth level. `Children` here was used to codename as in *Help House, that helps poor children*.
