# Nokia Homestuck

Family guy inspired moment

## Behind the Scene

Bamvas Togaff: Okay, Nepeta, Karkat? Good. Right, you see this hooded camera rig here?

(Medium square 1:1 ring light, white background, video camera)

Bamvas: I want you to do (self handholding to demonstrate basically) this hand holding together, slow and smooth. (Point to the example couple) Yes like that.

(Camera in position, front nokia start as usual)

Gutiff: (async) (give hand smoothly)

Varla: (async) (take hand)

(Camera behind their hands, behind nokia start)

Bamvas: Yeah, like that.

Nepeta Leijon: `:33<` umm..

Bamvas: Okay, Karkat, stand on the left view

Karkat Vantas: (stand on left side)

Bamvas: Nepeta, you on right.

Nepeta: `:33<` (stand on right)

Info: I'm tired of prefixing every Nepeta's caption / subtitle, Aaaaa!! Pls use prefix feature to automatically prefix, oh my God! Awaiting order that allowed me to skip prefix though.

Bamvas: Now, you ready?

Karkat: (see Nepeta)

Nepeta: `:33<` (see Karkat)

Bamvas: Camera,

Arri Alexa: (start recording)

Info: we forgot the clapper, but eh, no sound needed anyways

Bamvas: Light, Action..

## Nokia Startup after update

(Portrait smartphone)

Karkat: (async) (Give hand)

Nepeta: (async) `:33<` (Take the hand)

(Nokia startup jingle vibraphone 2009, Nokia new logo)...

(Fade to white)

(Enter the lockscreen)

## Consumer

(Outview the phone)

Jeging Gugam: ... Since when their hand turns gray? Jesus, they need help?

Pogom Mumu: Maybe they forgot to turn on color during recording.

Jeging: I mean, they glorified color before, why suddenly black and white now?, now that also this cringy NOKIA logo that also turns black in this measly white background. Where's the blue?!

Pogom: Sir, your blue filter. I saw blue.

Jeging: oh (turn off blue color filter in his eyes) sh88. Okay. You saw blue?

Pogom: Yes.

Jeging: well, anyway, AOKIA? That's just cringe.
