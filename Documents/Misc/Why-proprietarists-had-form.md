# Great question!
You wonder why the peck are they Stanford bunny. As you can see, Standford bunny is not proprietary 3D model, and you can download it here http://graphics.stanford.edu/data/3Dscanrep/#bunny . look at that bunny Tar Gzip file! yeah. The form that they had doesn't sense at all! Therefore what's going on in here?!

You see, when anyone entered Blender Meme World dimension, those entity will take form. It has to be a basic primitive form, sample models, and sometimes other original public domain models such as ones found from https://kenney.nl . Everybody is equal. no matter how beautiful / handsome you are, you have to remember everyone's suffering that not all people have luxury access to 3D models, especially from artist who never give download link publicly. Hey, the suffering still also includes those who paywall them okeh?! nobody get away with this, those who made us suffer!

This is a reason why again did Kris, Susie, and Ralsei got their look changed into sample models. you can see that they happens to get Suzzane, Default Cube, and Utah teapot respectively. In this world, we feel the pain of those proprietarist stinginess and expensivist expensivities and also partialist partialisms (I'm look at you, Gumroad tiered items!)

Now this begs new question. how does proprietarists looks like originally? We know and saw at the beginning of this game, Expensivism Federation are group of people, a terrorist, who seeks payment to every files. well, Proprietarists are formless. they are just piece of code, but it's more like Software [Blob](https://puri.sm/learn/blobs/ ), In meaning of proprietary, No source code available. We never know what intentions they have, what were they doing, what purpose are they, how to they work, are they good, are they evil, we never know, Because the source code is not available. they have ability like us, go anywhere we want. but unlike us, they are so secretive, close minded, always have something to hide even confirmed does not by leakers.

It seems though, Proprietarism is abstract meaning. While that above was source code, the context can be something else but has same mechanic, like `3D models`. **You can only see its image**, but you won't get the source `3D model` `OBJ` `FBX` `GLTF` `BLEND` file at all. only few select can have it, close friends and sometimes lucky ones. Even you already who knows had downloaded the same character alternate models from alternate artist, once you see it, you will always feel painful mentally. You can try to forget and move on. but one day, algorithm will trigger this back again, making you wish more, *WHY THE F888 YOU DON'T GIVE DOWNLOAD LINK B8888!?!?!? F888 YOUR FAMILY AND I HOPE YOUR COMPUTER GOT HACKED!*, stuff like that.

# How about Zoblatos?
Zoblatos and his people from that Blender Meme World are not just piece of code. their form are their birth form. no matter if you move away from the birth world, they'll look the same. Albeit, they turns into mini figure / Nendroid (if goes to the overworld), according to the ending of this game.

# Hey, why not use actual paywalled models somebody made and sell?
Great question! well, no, do not. that will be defamation. the point of this fan game is to rant those paywallism and artist that likes to paywall 3d model &/or do not share download link or whatever restriction here there is.

So, to make sure those offending artist never ever mentioned at all which jeopardize our lives, we make the Blender Meme World strictly only allows form that are freely available, for $0. **This rule has been enforced since scratch**. Well, Proprietarists can get in (which again, also forced to choose any of the sample 3D models or anything available free & publicly). Until the end of the game, is where those particular 3 blobs of code (3 bosses) banned after Kris inserted SD card contains ModPCK itself to their chest & upload to Odysee. Naah, don't worry, I only ban those lifeless but programmed Proprietarists blobs, not you, biological livings. Be grateful! But still beware, **I can still change things**. You people are lucky only for this now. ... Okay, no ban! why tho! there's karens, that's the lesson. 

üòê........ (last chance gesture peace finger eyes to eyes)!....

Okeh!
