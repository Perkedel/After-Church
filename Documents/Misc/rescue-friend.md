Aski: Oh man, that sh88 is no joke!

Bosher: Oh..

Latsufir: But don't worry. We're safe now. Away from war.

Bosher: Yeah man. Hey, How did you get there? There are alot of Russians there. Rescue vehicles had already attempted but failed. all shot down.

Latsufir: Well, that's because (point to the portal module) We have teleporter. We first assemble at the scene, aand, go straight to Aski's house. Then, take Aski & portal again behind border, so they're not suspicious.

Bosher: Oh wow!

Latsufir: Yeah, 1 missile during our trip, and another right after we got Aski in the car.

Bosher: Jesus Christ!

Latsufir: It's miracle, that we got Gastunov twins. They have power of force field & buble wrap field. Our car did rolled upside down but with the help of spherical bubble, the battery on the floor can tumble it back upright.

Bosher: Awesome!! But, batteries on floor? So that's what makes it act like stone in balance toy?
