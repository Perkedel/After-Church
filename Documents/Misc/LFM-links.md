- Account collections https://cointr.ee/joelwindows7 (Not only Crypto but also non-crypto social medias too as well!!! also I hate NFT. it's a scam, limiting amount of stock even it is digital where things can be copied infinitely. that OpenSea & Mintables btw was me, but you are allowed to right click save as it yess! It was there for security in case somebody NFTfy my art (a.k.a. not me minting it, I don't want anyone mint my arts!). You can't do this, you d888heads!)
