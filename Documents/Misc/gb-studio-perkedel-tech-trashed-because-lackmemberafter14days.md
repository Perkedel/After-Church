I think that the two members minimum part could use some exceptions, for example, if I make a skin and everything there is made by me, I should have the option to upload it under the studio name. The studio had no part in its creation, it's an individual submission. If you need two people to form a studio, then you need two people to create studio submissions.

# Reason for protest
studio Perkedel Technologies due to less than 2 member after 14 days of its creation.
