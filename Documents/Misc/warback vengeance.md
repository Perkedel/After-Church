# Warback vengeance Cancel Culture

Hey listen. You guys have been exposing millions of people and destroyed their reputation beyond recovery. But I have to warn you. The victim will collect those who aren't yet murdered, not in your team, and even ex-team. Then collect bad past about you and spread it to also kill you. You basically have been trapped. No, no, it's long too late. You can't get out. You'll be forever exposing and be exposed, until eventually, everyone is.... bad and screwed up, no one is clean.

How to get out? None. You've been stuck. You did this to yourself. You should've never signed up the first place & start exposing. I'm sorry.
