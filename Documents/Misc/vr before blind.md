- Play VR, before you blind. A blind man with cane and VR headset, crying because he's had accident and became blind
- You can play VR, even if you blind. A bowl goal game. Camera sit next to opponent about to bowl the ball towards the other goal guarded by that goalie. Both are blind and this game is featured on every Para games. To make it fair, all players even just lower vision or full vision are blindfolded. The ball has ringing sound when rolling, so get the ball as where the ringing goes into.
