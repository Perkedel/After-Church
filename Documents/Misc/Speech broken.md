Uh, I need help. some may have reported this:
the spee.ch is broken right now.

I think you can reproduce this:
- upload any image you'd like.
- use your account. registering is working.
- write some descriptions, set license, and its url, tag it or not.
- Publish button

and whatever account, it goes to Thumbnails instead. not yours.  
I use a Chromium browser, Brave. Perhaps a problem regardless of browser?

also my bad didn't tell:
I have Spee.ch https://spee.ch/@JOELwindows7:b lbry://@JOELwindows7#b  
but somehow, the spee.ch drops the authentication database of that spee.ch, leaving only the LBRY data. I can't log in anymore with that.  
and it becomes available to register with that same username again. So I take opportunity to register with that username again and it works.  
Now I have new spee.ch https://spee.ch/@JOELwindows7:e lbry://@JOELwindows7#e
