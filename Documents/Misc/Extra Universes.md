# Extra Universes

Extra universes are series of dedicated or collection of alternate universe than Main Cinematic Universe. It can either serve for:
- Event that could not happen on Main due to timeline event and happening conflict. E.g., Celopatra Cyber futuristic is too changed compared to Main which focuses on closely as in IRL. Some films got Extra Imagination Universe, Dark Fail, War, etc.
- Props for a film, i.e. visiting one or more during shooting. E.g. Doctor Strange in Multiverse of Madness
- Adaptation, either business merging process, merge failure, copyright strike, etc. E.g., Spiderman film belongs to Sony, and is not Marvel Studios, i.e. different universe
- Fan works. A.k.a. AU / Alternate Universe. Original owners may also have full control over their franchise & moderate as necessary. Don't worry, as long as you also are Open Source we are happy to provide you support & foster your amazing work of arr.

Can entities transfer / immigrate? Possible. If a universe becomes either too harmful or no longer interesting, entity will try to immigrate. Note that success rate as of 5 April 2023 is still relatively low and trends are slowly decreasing at the moment. However, the rate never goes below .01% to this day. We also have to apologize that this score may be inaccurate since immigration event quantity is very low / very rare due to how Universe works (Theoretically contained & entities dependency with the universe law of everything in it)
