# Pronoun confusta

Question `What's your prefered pronoun` is non-standard. This is from Earth, but no standard body across galaxies agree to this idea, for now.

This can be a cutaway for family guy inspired

## Pre-cutaway

A: Ugh, Planet Earth? I think gonna be sick.

B: Why sick?

A: Those people are notorious for letting LGBT in. I'd be asked what my pronouns are, they won't assume my sex either 2 anymore. Yuck!

## Begin

Wert: Okay. Next, what's your prefered pronoun?

Paula Yomberina (Bow kid): huh? `Pronoun`?

Wert: Yeah. Is it `He/Him`, `She/Her`, or `They/Them`? C'mon, queues alot!

Bow kid: Oh!!! Uh... Female!

Wert: ðŸ¤¨...

Bow kid: Sorry, `She/Her`.

Wert: Thank you. (Internally) transphobic!.. (end)

Bow: What did you say?!

Wert: Heh, nothing..

## Mid-cutaway

C: No need to worry, guys. That guy has been fired 2 months ago for *his* bad remarks. You should be safe now re-registering.

## Begin 2

Jackal: Sorry moher (They/them custom). Your behaviour is beyond tolerance.

Wert: NO, I can fix this. I swear won't do this again.

Jackal: Guess what, Twitter people like you are being rampant these days. I cannot afford for my customer to feel unwelcome just one nanosec. What the hell, `Transphobic`?!?!

Wert: Sir,

Jackal: NO BUT!!! We have been working hard to be as inclusive as possible. I even made my wife mentally ill (because she is extreme LGBTphobic and puke on every LGBT people she encounter), just so my customer whose gender and pronoun non-standard also served.

Wert: Sir, I tr (`try` interupted)

Jackal: You are wrong again. What you did is reverse discrimination, got it? You did despised a normal person who normally believes only in 2 genders.

Wert: ...

Jackal: **GET OUT!!!** Pack your stuffs.

Wert: ðŸ˜¡

Jackal: You did this so many times. You said so too many offensive discrimination in your heart during work. Customer can read your mind, that's how I know it, you know. I can't help you anymore.
