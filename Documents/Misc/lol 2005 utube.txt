hi guys, today, I'm gonna show you, how to download OBS, Open Broadcaster software.
first, open any internet browser.
type obsproject.com
click your platform. In this case I already have it.
also I have already installed it. now, let me show you how does it look's like.
OBS is comprehensive! but if you understand, it works well like professional!!!! yeahhhh!!!

Most importantly you have to make sure you have the capture, on the source
Make sure it is display capture. there, choose correct display for which to capture.d


















for laptop, you have to make sure that you have run this OBS with integrated graphics.
that is because the laptop, like this one has 2 GPUs, one is weak and one is render only and strong.
"to save battery". pathetic!

here is how: to Nvidia setting! loading, takes long time!
there you are!
now you go to Manage 3D setting. and click Program Settings.
select that OBS. both of them. change it to Integrated graphics.
For this case, I don't want to do that, because the laptop will lag if I do that.
for full capture purpose, I would have to. but then, I will only rely on specific Window capture instead.

If you insist on doing full capture, you can do it for temporarily. watch me how.
there. you got it? I hope so. Otherwise, please rewind a little bit.

All laptop in default will use Integrated Graphics. But I changed it in honor for stronger Nvidia 1050 TI prefference.

If you need help, you can use the help here. link in the description, along with involved items.

that is all. I am not affiliated with OBS yet. thank you for watching this joke. lol!
