# TRIGGER WARNING!!! Based on True Story: 9/11
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/September_11_attacks

Despite 9/11 is a true story, but in this universe in this Inside Out TVA thingy, **all characters involved are fictional and entirely different**. No reference to anyone based irl at all. If we happened to got them similar in any variable, that's all coincidence. Obviously, deep condolences to those people IRL that, yeah you know. idk what to say.

What if a mischief guy with team of fearful emotions inside made mess in Twin Tower but ended up rescuing all people including those hijacked in plane?

# Begin
## Jeffrey Federson, House, New york. 2000
Paranoia (Fear, male): (Seeking future)...

Exciteful (Joy, male): Hey Paranoia. you found something?

Paranoia: Hang on a sec... (found bad future)!! Uh no! (analyzing plane crash to somekind of building)... Oh my...

Scatful (Disgust, male): Is it somekind of destruction?

Paranoia: More or less... NO! it's... Everyone's dead!

Scatful: What?

Paranoia: No, I mean, not all, alot!

Depressive (Sadness, male): I guess we have to discuss this tomorrow. It's already 9 PM!

Paranoia: (stop seeking future)!! Yeah. (signal to write this to a note).

## Meeting space. The next day
Depressive: The planning takes time to execute. We need to know what's inside the building, where's this, where's that.

Exciteful: wait! I remember! we friends do we? there are 2 working in twin tower! We can tell them this!

Depressive: Well, I think that works. If you should, maybe we can try!

Exciteful: Yeah! you know.

Bermin: You kidding right?

Ulysess: Trust him man. He's Oracle here. You know how many times he's been exactly right before? He was guesses that our opponent wins, and it did.

Bermin: Sorry, but I only trust God. I am not be feared with some kind of witchery, I fear God. He must have been in halucination again.

Ulysess: Hey listen. Joseph (in Bible, if not wrong) is oracle. what if Jeffrey also is one, sent from God? You should for this time, get out from your comfort zone.

JOELwindows7 (watcher): SO.. this is went the nexus event happened. instead of Bermin disagreeing, this one he agrees. Well uh, actually Jeffrey supposed not to `party` after all with the oracle he got, but again. In this nexus event, Jeffrey decided to tell his friend about it.

Bermin: Alright.. fine. If I lost my job, I'll report you to police.

Jeffrey: Now that's my buddy.

Ulysess: So, I know how does the tower works.

Ulysess: whoah, uuh.

Jeffrey: I guess now this is my turn.

Ulysess: Buddy, do not do this. We've atleast...

Jeffrey: Trust me!

Ulysess: Okay. but you have to do this right before it happened.

## Jeffrey

Ulysess: Did you.. moved everyone?

Jeffrey: I have.

Ulysess: You okay?

Jeffrey: tired, I'm okay.

Ulysess: Whew, thank God.

## Jeffrey
Paranoia: It's a success! everyone but terrorists are safe.

Exciteful: YEAY!!!

## Outside
Tower A: (foundation melted)!!! (Collapse)!!!..

Bermin: Whoah! whoawhoawoawoawoawoawoa!!!

Ulysess: Well, if that's not because of Jeffrey, things would become different.

## Jeffrey
Exciteful: Congratulations, Paranoia!! and all of you guys! Hip hip?

## Outside
Ulysess: No no no buddy, wake up. You need to see this. You're our hero. Please!

Jeffrey: (Head explode with reset charge)!!!

(reseting Timeline)

## TVA
Lawful: ... How do I say this? We've never seen in the history of TVA, some variant managed to make variance in the absolute point in time, I mean, in appocalypse like this. There often no variance occur during this type of event even a variant mess things around it. Don't get me wrong, it's very difficult you know. I would say that this is an impressive move. But still, what you guys have done absolutely made things worse or even create destruction of the universe.

Furious: What do you mean?! Don't you see they're innocent? they're about to get killed. If we don't act then everyone dead! DEAAAD!!!

Lawful: Dead? I get it. but it is a heavy sacrifice that unfortunately has to be done in order to save universe.

Scatful: Like what? creating flood of bloods everywhere and traumas for years to come? You are maniac!

Lawful: Right, I get it. We rather the other way around because those terrorist never stop until they got bloods everywhere. This supposedly also motivates Children of the Future to build final terrorist extermination system that once and for all completely destroy terrorist like in the Endgame once upon a time I've seen before. Wanna know what if you stop one of the small here? (open imagination monitor) Look. This is the future if you stopped them now. the terrorist have completely conquered the entire universe because as no trauma etched there'll be no motivation at all. Sometimes deaths in million is needed to have quarter inch of motivation to blast the bad off. Scary but efficient.

Furious: Great, he's maniac. Just cut to the chase and do whatever the f888 with us with it or bring us f8888 back right now!

Lawful: Alright, cut to the chase. You guys are very dangerous to the universe and for your action you'll be sentenced... `PRUNE`.

Scatful: Prune? what is that?

Obeyful A: (prune Paranoia)

Paranoia: OAAAA!!! (went to ends of time)

Obeyful B: (prune Depressive)!!! (prune Scatful)

Scatful: HOOAAAA!!!!

Exciteful: Please, I can explain.

Obeyful A: (prune Exciteful)!!

Furious: (about to fight)...

Obeyful B: (about to prune Furious)..

Furious: (punch Obeyful B face)!!! (take Prune stick)! (Jump to Lawful's table)

Lawful: Whoawhoahoa!!! help!

Furious: Where did they go? A8888LE!??

Lawful: I don't know!!! (confidential secret)

Obeyful A: (finally pruned Furious)!!

Furious: OAAAAA!!! (but witnessed the TVA smartphone under his foot and take it just right before his hand prunes) 🖕 (smartphone also in that hand)!!!

Lawful: NONONONONOOOOoo!!!! My computer!

Obeyful A: Sir, you alright?

Lawful: I'm okay. He took my computer!

Bountiful: Well, we still have the backup in warehouse.

Lawful: I know. We're done. the variant now has the power. Guys, if you spotted him, stab him, don't prune.

Bountiful: Yes, sir.

## Ends of time
Paranoia: (awake) ugh! ... .. .. wha, where am I?

Exciteful: Paranoia? oh thank goodness.

Paranoia: Hey? Exciteful, Scatful, ... and Depressful. what's this place?

Exciteful: me too, idk. C'mon we gotta find the safe place, I don't think this is safe here.

Paranoia: no I guess, nowhere safe. Where's Furious?

Furious: (appears)!!!

Paranoia: There he is.

## Built a hut
Exciteful: Okay, I guess this is good for now.

Furious: Guys, why we give up? look what I found! (show TVA smartphone)

Exciteful: no pecking way.

Paranoia: But this time, we have to be careful. We need a plan

Exciteful: That's right! plan!
