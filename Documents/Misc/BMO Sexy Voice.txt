BMO's sexy voice

One day 4 friends: S-Karfe, Sudo Harvester, Kidnoz Taregan, and Lipid Alendarn, was staying on Finn's tree house. They were staying 3 nights, waiting for TransSolar to be working again due to the technical issues. Supposedly arrive at Musk city at Mars right now, but yeah, error happends anytime.
Anyway, back to topic.
4 friends were on the 3rd floor. Finn was going to do some business with Princess Bubblegum for something. Jake also follows as usual.
Finn: "Alright guys, I've got something to do. You guys keep this place. Alright?"
Sudo: "Yep, we're good!"
Finn: "Catch you guys later!"
Jake: "See ya!"
Sudo, S-Karfe, Kidnoz, Lipid: "Bye! GBU! 😉"
And now is only 4 friends, and BMO.

5 minutes later, they got bored. Sudo, deploys a boring board game from his laptop. Kidnoz is not intrested, so only 3 dudes were in.
Kidnoz looking for something special, however he is careful guy. He hates to messing someone's property up. So he stays, with BMO ahead.
Kidnoz stares as BMO, and something amazing for him happenned.
Kidnoz: "Wait a minute, is that headphone jack? 😱 *GASP* NO WAY!!! I'VE NEVER SEEN THIS IN A LONG LONG TIME!"
S-Karfe: "Phones these days, never have headphone jack anymore. The plague was started by Apple since around 2017 for a bold claim of thickness. Yeah, that BMO, who made it? That way they act should be appreciated."
Kidnoz: "Hey, should we connect this? I can't be patient to hear its HD voice! 😃😃😃😃😃😃😃😃😃💓💓💓❤💓❤💓💗💛💙💛💚💜"
S-Karfe: "Yeah why not? You should try it. There's no harm I believe."
Kidnoz: "Alright, wait a sec, I'm going to take my handsfree!"
Kidnoz ran to his carry bag to find his handsfree. Found it! It is expensive cabled handsfree from AKG.
Sudo: "Whoah, dude, you still have wired headset? Don't you know everyone now has wireless one already?"
Kidnoz: "Nah, I'm good. Besides, every wireless can have some latency and even can lose connection. So, I don't want to be tedious setting it up everytime. Just plug in, and done!"
Sudo: "Do you feel some hurdles to handle it?"
Kidnoz: "tbh, just a tangle, but I have been used to it. Oh yeah, this case I got here rolls it up so it kept tidy as prime."
Sudo: "Oh, okay 🤔. Alright, do it then 😉."
Kidnoz: (earbuds on his ear) "Alright. Here we go. Let's just do it." (Take deep breath and connect the end of headset to its jack on BMO.)
The handsfree is now connected. He can immersively listen to BMO voice which is much better compared to its internal speaker.
Kidnoz: "Oh, okay, not so bad, hehe. Right, BMO, say some word or something!"
BMO: (speaking litterally) "Hi, My name is BMO. I am your best friend in a form of compact robot 🤖. Wink! 😉"
Kidnoz: "Oh. My God. Ahhhhhhh." (Fell faint of cuteness kawaii!!!)
Kidnoz fell faint once he heard its sexy voice. Rest 3 friends got astonished. They then quickly come towards Kidnoz.
Sudo: "Whoahwhoawhoa! Dude, are you alright? What's going on?!?! 😨 Tell me!!"
Kidnoz: (amaze confuse face) "Her voice, is SEEEEEEEEXXXXYYYYYYYYYYY! 😌😌😌😌😌😌😌😌"
Sudo took over his earbuds and...
Sudo: "BMO? What did you do?"
BMO: "I just said my introduction string made of word generator."
Sudo: (nod to Kidnoz) "Dude, you are seriously very right! Guys, get him to a bed somewhere, and give him much drink! (To BMO that was about to walk away) Whoahowhoa, careful this one is expensive. Uhhh, excuse me (unplugging handfree from the jack). There you go." (Tidying up handsfree to the case and putting it in the bag)
3 friends brought Kidnoz to a wooden sofa left there. Sudo deployed cushion for his comfort.
Sudo: "Alright here's your bag. I've also put your handsfree and its casing right where it was belongs to."
Kidnoz: "thx 🙍"
Sudo: "There you go, thx, BMO. Here, Kidnoz, drink this."
Kidnoz: (gulp the drink)
Sudo: "Dude, how do you feel right there?"
Kidnoz: "I feel like, a korean girl has spoken to me, saying hello. Like, like, like, I fell into a K-Drama world or something. 😍😍😍😍😍😍"
Sudo: "You are right! Hey, btw, I noticed something that surprise me about this incident?"
Kidnoz: "Oh yeah, what is that?"
Sudo: "If I'm not wrong, last time I heard her voice sounds similar, to some characters around here? I'm not sure, I think, sounds like the one who is long, and is rainbow stripe, and has thorn upon her head. I forgot who is she I'm talkin..."
Kidnoz: "Lady Rainicorn?"
Sudo: "Yes, that's right! Only this time speaks English! Wow, never heard she speak that language very well despite unnative accent which stucks on her local accent, hehe."
Kidnoz: "I don't know why it is? But someone said, because same voice actor... In this case, Niki Yang."
Sudo: "Correct! Wow, her voice is very clear Ultra-HD when we listened her over headphone jack. That's why it is appreciated so much."
Kidnoz: "Yeah dude. I wish everyone here starts to listen to us. (Listen to customer for headphone jack thingy returns)"
Not mentioned, Chloe Park's mother, is also voice by Niki Yang. You saw the kawaii struct bubble already, and the image of her appeared on bottom left from head to waist.
Lipid and S-Karfe tried the sexy BMO voice as well.
Lipid: "Wow, this voice is extremly Kawaii!"
S-Karfe: "Not bad! It compares to my wife's (Z-Gothic) too!"
Lipid: "Yep!"

4 hours later...

Finn: "We're home guys!"
4 friends: "woohoo!"
4 friends come over to greet Finn and Jake.
Sudo: "Hey, whatsupp? How was is going?"
Finn: "Awesome. Just a little problem on powersurge. Generator's outdated but we got it done."
Sudo: "Oh I see. Nice job. Nice job."
Finn: "😃"
Sudo: "Hey, would you like to get something special? I've made this gift for you!"
Finn: "Oh thx! What is it?"
Sudo: "Come're!! I'll show you!"
Finn and 4 friends goes to the family room on 3rd floor. Finn was brought to the BMO.
Finn: "Where is it?" (Sudo plugged the earbuds onto Finn's ear) "Whoah!"
Sudo: "Hey BMO, try sing something!"
BMO sang Finn's favourite song just by acapela.
Finn: "😳😳😳😳😳😳😳😳😳......*slowmo gasp*........😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱"
Sudo: "Wow dude, you took a long deep breath using that slowmo gasp!"

Sudo: "How does it feel?"
Finn: "Hold on a sec, uh, I'll be right back."
Finn gets a full hue of blush on his cheek.
Jake: "What's wrong with Finn? I wonder what did this do?" (Puts earbuds to his ear)
Sudo: "Jake, wait! Be careful! 😨"

Sudo: "see! I was not wrong."
Jake: "how did you know that it was like her voice?"
Sudo: "uhhh, honestly, we saw your wikia. There are many fans right there."
Jake: "Oh, that's right, I forgot."
Finn: (return back to meeting point after serveral heart pounding issues) "phew. Sudo, why is BMO sounds like that?"
Sudo: "I don't know! Why don't you ask Warner Bros.? They are right in front of you."
Finn: "Why, Warner brothers?"
Director: "because we don't want to high budget. Most importantly it sounds different to you right? Also, we make sure that it is a creative process. Yeah, turns out, this one goes to be a match, lol!"
Finn: "Awesome, thx."
Sudo: "Wow, never been hearing and I wonder if Lady Rainicorn speaks English. Or better, Bahasa Indonesia! Hahahaha!"
Jake: "Ah, shut up! You just made me blush more!"
Sudo: "Oh, sorry hehehehe. Jk. Maybe someday it will."
Jake: "hmph! 😡😳"
S-Karfe: "Hey dude, the TransSolar is ready again tomorrow! But this was just 2 days out of 3 days."
Sudo: "wow, so quick. Never expected that."
BMO: "Sudo, don't go! Please! Stay here for a while! 😖"
Sudo: "I'm sorry BMO, but we have important quest. I cannot be late for that. Look here (show smartphone). I've settled this appointment for Wednessday this week. See?
BMO: "Ohhhhh 😢"
Sudo: "Finn, Jake, If you want to join me, feel free. I'll be glad for that. 😊"
Finn: "Hold on... Oh sorry man, I also have quest. It is about technology investment again."
Lipid: "What is that?"
Sudo: "(whisper to Lipid) Not sure, we'll find out later. (To Finn) Okay. If you have done, and have much free time, feel free to join us, right at we were here (knock NFC to BMO about the Google Share Location) (Finn and Jake amazed). (To all) We have to sleep, guys! C'mon!"
And they went to bed. 4 friends prayed before sleep.
