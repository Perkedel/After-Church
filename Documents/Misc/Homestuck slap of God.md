## Post-cutaway

JOELwindows7: (stop imagination simulation)! Eeeeyeaaa, So nope. Yeah, maybe we should.. idk how to careful. But most importantly, we should not fight with another mind manipulator, easy.. But how do we supposed to tell? Say that, informations right now limited, no confirmation yet if that target had mind manipulations ability. Basically it.
