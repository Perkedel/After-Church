# I blame my father

Cutaway for Family Guy inspired

## Pre-cutaway

C (3rd party repair shop): Um, sorry sir. The piston broke, look at this (show pieces of exploded piston). You didn't use original product did you?

A: Ugh, look at this. the piston worn & crumble to pieces & there's alot of dust to it. **I blame my father** for this. The official told us already to replace the filter & use OEM Oil.

B: Buddy, you said this so many times. 

A: Yeah, why? Coz he's cheap.

B: No.. Yeah, that. You gotta stop doing that. That's unhealthy amount already.

## Cutaway 1

(Scene 1)

A: ... I blame my father for this

(repeat to another scene above serveral times, clip same `I blame my father`)

## Post-cutaway

B: Look, I understand your dad has budget preferences. But

A: No shut up. That's it. I should've thrown him away last time I could.

B: Okay. Please do not throw your dad to retirement house. You're gonna get stoned (Malin Kundang).

A: Then I'll unstone myself! Easy!

B: No, that's impossible. I'm talking about credits. He married your mom to born you, then you throw him away just because he's a cheapskate? Is he only cheap on that?

A: No, everything!

B: Yeah, okay. put aside, you gotta wake up for this one. that brand is notorious for cumsucking you alot. They despise you for repairing things yourself. They're Apple of motorcycle.

## Cutaway 2

D (in style of Money Talks Wireless): What happen to your phone sir?

E: Just this. Green screen. Apple quoted us 200 Kvz.

D: Don't worry, I got you.

Narrator (spongebob style): 5 and a half minutes later..

D: You phone is ready sir.

E: See, I told ya!

(E uploads another political heated hot takes video about this issue & encourage to boycott Apple if haven't already. My dad wouldn't be interested with that because it's not regular politcal hot takes, but others like me will, except that hate speech kinda thing boycott. Maybe there's a better way.)
