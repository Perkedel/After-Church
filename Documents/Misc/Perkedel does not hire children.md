# Perkedel does not hire children

We understand, many Hollywood industries do in fact hired children for their films which characters are children.

But at Perkedel who strives on full flexibility on use of our character here with our universes, we unfortunately unable to allow children or any beings currently aged less than their biological mature age to apply as the actor for the character. Not only this would constitute for child labour, but also, if any of our fans decided to R34 these characters, yeah you already know & no need to imagine how screwed up would that be, regardless whose custom unofficial actors applied within such fan dubs.

Fortunately, it is possible that some adults can and in fact have the ability to pitch and tones to sounds like a child, i.e. loli voices. As in tricks like in many Hollywood industries, sometimes they used a woman to voice a young boy e.g., since decontextifyingly, it could be representable as such. Therefore, any tiny form characters shall be filled also with maturely aged participants, optionally & preferably with such pitch and toning abilities.

Originally, children participants would be rewarded with sweets and their favourite foods, but once again, our decision had already made absolute. We apologize for your inconveniences. You may apply again once you have reached your mature ages according to your being.

Make note however, due to inconsistency of demands, taste, perceptions with such snacks, you will only be rewarded with money as usual. You can use these money to spend for candies your own.

As always, we expect all participants to especially agree and consent that characters you play may be played with by our fans / gamers for any purpose but not limited to **an event that are considered lewd**, as boldy stated in your contract form.  
*Yeah, You'll agree that sometimes you will be porn actors. Because you cannot control what gamers would do with our characters.*
