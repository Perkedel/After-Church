# Briefing
Good evening, 47. Your target is **LUSIO HONGLING**, also known as *The Nationalist*.  
He is famous for organizing cyber attacks specifically to Virtual Idols üêêüêêüêêüêêüêê‚ùé, and one of the victim went viral. Lusio is very active at an anonymous social media where he and his friends collects intels that leads to reputation destruction of those virtual idols, and sometimes leads some of them to Suic8de.

Recently, Lusio had partnered with Hush together to build an artificial intelligence technology called **AI-NTI**, a Computer card that collects intel about virtual idols personal life and leak them to the internet. The card is really fast and efficient and could leak 10 idols per second just for one single card alone.  
Our client, **VirtualLive Productions** asked you to eliminate the target, as well as retrieving the AI technology along with their source code which easily accessible next to it.

Right now, the technology has been finished and Lusio is in ICA Data facility to retrieve the technology.  
Security has been increased around the area where the technology stored, so I suggest you to sneak through the loop hole behind their blind spot.

## Mission Active
We must act fast, 47. We are not letting him cancel more idols. And as always, **Great luck, 47.** 

# Gameplay
## Just started
Johan Carl: Good Evening, 47. Lusio has just arrived as you have had. He just entered from secure back door. He is going to retrieve the card. The scientist are preparing for the demonstration, followed with the presentation. And once Lusio approved it, he will setup the payment, in cash, which gives another time. Perhaps, in those windows of time, could be the opportunity for us to save the world. Great luck 47.

## infiltrated
Johan: Right, there is the card. Be careful not to get busted by those scientists around.

47: (got the card and stole its software source code)

Johan: Great job! now for the target

## longue
Johan: It looks like the target is being guarded by 3. and Oh, our client just said that you can eliminate them too, because they are NTI member that were also actively involved in reputation destructions.

47: (distract, subdue, and snap neck guards / garrote with fiber wire)

Lusio: Excellent, we shall try.
