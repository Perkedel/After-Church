# Briefing
Johan Carl: Good Morning, Chara. You target is **Sam Wilauhe Emer**. the highest ranked sniper and 1st place winner of FarShoot 2019. Notorious for being determined without mercy, and like to kill his victim as ordered, refuses any distractions. He has had total 120 body count over the past of his career, notably Representative Kuchak Kuchak of Planet Semonor, shot at his head during his talk at United Galaxies 2025 speech. Luckily though, Dasandimian came to the rescue and recovered him. 

Right now, Sam was sitting in watchtower at a Desert Headquarter to watch over intruders and eliminate incoming enemies in his sight immediately. Because his sight is 360 degree, aided with his assistant behind, you will start from bellow. In your way, 10 guards you have to pass: 4 above around manhole escape and 6 around the watchtower. Be careful, Chara. they got knives too, and they are really proficient knife throwers, and those **knife had lethal poison in it**. Be sure to eliminate them as well, as they are all **Bayabu** soldiers as well.

Once you have taken care all of the guards, you can shoot your vomit bullet, climb and then do your passion. Feel free to improvise if you want too.

Oh, btw, since I know you love killing, you may eliminate innocent Bayabu members as well. they are also terrorist too as I returned all their data about them. Pretty nasty indeed.

## Mission Active

That is all, and always... **Great Luck**.
