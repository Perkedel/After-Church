# The Real War That Matters

There is something that are more matter right now, as turns out, humans also scronches each other.

## Begin

### Moderation Dimension / Saorfa realm

(Assembled all trolls from Homestuck)

*3 Saorfas*: (enter)...

Terezi Pyrope: WH4T 4R3 W3 DO1NG H3R3?

Vriska Serket: We'll find out?

Arn: Greetings, gamers.

Yab: Welcome to Moderation Dimension.

Tab: You have been summoned here for an important matter.

Arn: Arn

Yab: Yab

Tab: Tab

*all 3 saorfas*: We are the keeper of this Perkedel Cinematic Universe and to ensure all things go well.

Terezi: (little applause) 4lright, cool.

Arn: Now. Little question. Do you remember or have any idea, how you people were manifested?

Terezi: HUH?

Yab: Born. From egg, cocoon, trials, lusus.

Terezi: WHY TH3 H3LL D1D YOU 4SK TH4T?! 😡

Tab: our apologies. Indeed, a rude question to ask for those who faced this dangerous things everytime for every of you. But you have any idea, what purpose were you?

*trolls*: (thinking) uhhh..

Yab: Simply said, what do you do, what's your favourite activities?

Haash Nlaktas: To make human suffer!

JOELwindows7: That's our OC, I want to make it easy while I was learning about this overmuch franchise of this.

*rest of trolls*: YEAH!!

Arn: Unfortunately, you're right. Or at least at it was found to be a name-after by [fans](https://mspaintadventures.fandom.com/wiki/Troll ). Clearly, that's not your clear purpose. What name-after I mean is that, it's internet trolls. You were initially keen on annoying and destroying humans, or often refered kids. Through chattings, were you go.

Yab: But now, there is something important we must show you.

Tab: As the fate of beings, are threatened, ironically, by each other.

Terezi: OK4Y, W41T?

Arn: That's right. No longer the time you play games of scronching each other. Because it's time to be the good example.

Yab: All your past, move on. You've seen been over-lengthily worked on, to the point, the plot become convoluted yet it simply is mostly about scronching, and random dramas, more it goes. I mean, [`Something bad happened`](https://youtu.be/wcEJh6BvxSs ). Luckily that's over or [does it](https://www.homestuck2.com/ ) ?.

Tab: But all, we must give shout out, to suprisingly, yet deserve to have full redemption over all this, Vriska Serket

*trolls*: (disagree) What!?!??

Arn: Let us tell you.

## The rescue

> Once upon a time, we were doing usual job, helping Kaorfa adopt more franchises. My job is to explore other universes, morely a franchise to see if I could discover one.

### Vriska makeshift house, Blackhole

Vriska (ghost): (sit depressed)....

> And that day, I found Vriska, as Kaorfa has begun the mission for Homestuck / MsPaint Adventure, and we have entered.

Arn: (enter to this strange place)!! Okay. That feels dark. (Notice a spirit of a person with weird candy corn horn)?, Hello? You alright?

(No response)

Arn: It appears that you need help. (Rescan spatial condition)... Oh wow. It's blackhole. (Scan Vriska's sprite brain).... Okay. [Congratulations](https://mspaintadventures.fandom.com/wiki/Homestuck:_Act_7 ). But how did you ended up here though?

### Moderation Table

(Vriska asleep on table)

Arn: (looking at her)..

Yab: (arrive).

Tab: (arrive).

Yab: **She has went alot**.

Tab: her story is very complicated. Much as so with overall franchise. To be blunt (terus terang), I have experienced bloating sensation in my cranial system.

Yab: Me too.

Arn: Perhaps we shall just...

(Camera look Vriska)

Arn: Give her 83rd chance (async).

(Badum..)

Arn: (tell MIDI player to silence) Shush.

(Stop sfx)

*Speaker Singleton*: (sadd)...

Yab: We also should check other entities. Perhaps a good idea to investigate further.

Arn: Well apparently, it has been a vast majority size and complexity, we could be lost spatially and may not do anything significant even though we can return anytime. Perhaps Vriska knows who and can guide us.

Yarn: Well. Shall we?

Arn: (draw right hand for the power), Here we go. (Awake Vriska + Vriska moment glimpse bubble absorbs, try merging)!! (Relax hand), Awake.

Vriska: (waking up slowly)...

Arn: Welcome, to the Perkedel Cinematic Universe. Arn.

Yab: Yab.

Tab: Tab.

Arn: We are the keeper of this universe. I have read your record. Only partially.

Tab: There has been alot of tangles in your story. I had experiencing difficulty during this.

Yab: But your final action suggests that you deserve something better. We appreciate your sacrifice for the rest of the beings over there.

Arn: Once again, you shall not end like this. It is unfair for the rest of the people lives further, and you closing up just so to correct your bad action.

Tab: We are no longer to confirm, if at some point would they commemorate for your heroic action in that next timeline (homestuck 2), just because of your past bad actions, significantly 2 or more.

Yab: I have seen Antman 2, btw.

Arn: Basically it. We can put Darren asside, since his feud was one personal spaces. But not sure for you, since you have more than 1 feud for multiple personal spaces. You have an interesting remark, which we can use to.. improve you.

Tab: At least, there is something, where you can be, ... a better person.

Yab: As you can see we need your help. What if we turn 180°? If you were a bad person, perhaps we can make you, a better, in the same, for much further. Because turns out,

Arn: Beings scronching each other. Certainly yours too. Perhaps you can make it cease.

Tab: But you cannot do this alone. You have others who live and perhaps went neglected in the next timeline.

Yab: Yes, we can bring them here with you, so won't be alone. You see, it is best if you had your mate with you.

Arn: Do you know where they are? Do not worry. We will try our best to untangle any jumble mess along the way.

Vriska: .... (look left)

(Camera far look to against Vriska looking at)

Arn: (saw the next timeline) Thancc. Wow, it seems [that's all](https://www.homestuck2.com/story/407 ) for now, from what can we see.

Yab: The rest said [to be worked on](https://www.homestuck2.com/about ). **Away from our view**.

Tab: Worry not. Since the story keeps getting too complicated, farvaway from the existing (real life story) btw, We'll fork it from here.

Arn: And bring fixes along the way.

> And so, it began.

(Vriska ask Saorfa to cure everyone, which she scronched etc etc. E.g. restore Tavros legs and crotch. Saorfa made it better, stronger legs. Also Saorfa restored Vriska eyes & left arm in return. Also even better, both eyes and both arm stronger and advanced)

Vriska: (feel her both better real arm & better both eyes).. (happy)...

Arn: Now. Is there any favour, once again you'd like to ask? Don't worry, there is no limit. We'll handle this.

Vriska: I think I remem8er something..

Yab: Yess?

(Camera look at Vriska dead straight)

Vriska: (look front)..

### Somewhere in US, Earth

Tavros Nitram: (wake up), .... (notice his leg feel stronger)?... (stand up), (nothing looks different) hMM? (want to walk out of the room), (open door), (accidentally stubbed toe but that destroy the bottom part of door instead) oh sh88!! wHAT THE? (Head down), (accidentally destroyed middle part of the door with his right horn and did not feel a thing)?.... (re stand up & step back)!. (Analyze damage), wHAT'S GOING ON??

Joel: Tavros can adjust extra strength on head and leg. Even can be negative to make the smash like a little pat silk touch. Perfect for stealth zero sound step and sudden seruduk from behind. Also how do we supposed to work on punctuation here? Comma is also period for him. I'll take a look at this later.

### Another part in US, Earth

Terezi: (felt suddenly her vision getting sharper)???... oh wow, wh4t?.. (hands still on keyboard, and can feel texture in great detail, material, and its color, and can even scan 3D environment by touch like a star nose mole) WHOWHOWHOW... UH.... (As well as strong smell) (sniff) (sniff).. OH MY GOSH, 1T ST1NKS! WOW, 1M SM3LLS.. UMM, 1 th1nk 1 n33d to show3r.

Joel: Terezi's better eyes can also block blinding light (not too much, not too long though), and her better skin can remove pain in an expose to physical traumas. Combine with Vriska's better eyes to have xray and Terezi's sharp smell to match target by looks and scent.

### Back again

Arn: Anything else?

Vriska: ... (look up slowly, implying to fix more people)..

Arn: Got it.

## Reconcile

Arn: The rest is history.

*trolls*: (slowly look at vriska flabbergastedly)...???

Yab: Gamers, there is no time to think. You people have went through a lot, and now is your chance.

Tavros: (little cry moved)...

Tab: Do you accept, Vriska's apology, for what has she did. These better limbs you suddenly got, was her apology cake.

Vriska: (look Tavros)...

Tavros: (look Arn)??

Arn: (looking at them).. (little nod up meaning *c'mon, you can do it*)..

Tavros: (back look to Vriska).. (look leg Vriska gave)... (look up to Vriska)... oKAY.

Vriska: (cry movedly and hug fast)!!

Tavros: wHOA.... (wrap hands around Vriska to reply hug). (Right palm pat pat). . .

*rest of trolls*: (hug Vriska)....

Yab: Isn't this Wholesome?

Arn: At last, we have reached: `ReCONciLE`.

Tab: I am indeed moved.

## Matters at hand

(Tell the real war, illustrated in 3D imaginated, squidgame Jihun style)

(World War Explodos on the left side of room)!!!

(Slower motion abit ocassionally, cinematically B roll style)

*trolls: (finish hugging).., (look the source of explosion on the left)?? (A rubbled art studio, poor artist, and an enemy that is about to claim victory)

Victim guy: (sitt defeated).. please, have mercy.

Harrasser guy: (finished inspecting loli art canvas), (destroy it by flaming out of his left hand)!!!, (draw gun with right hand),

Victim: (cover with hand plea) NOo!!

*group of harassers*: (appears out of blue), (also drew their gun)!!

Victim: Please, I have kids. They need food!

(Camera look overall war scene)

*all harassers*: (aim ensure)... (empty up gun full of `flags` and `ratio`)!!!

Victim: (got scratched full guro & pained) AAAAAAAAAARGH!!!

Joel: Andrew, stop putting `BULLET RAIN LOL` During this moment. This is serious.

*trolls*: (went pitiful) 😥...

*all harassers*: (keep shooting until Victim goes critical)!!!!!!!!!!!!! (Finished emptying).

Victim: (lied up, & desperate catching breaths as his lung torn heavily) hhh, hhh, hhh, hhh, hhh, hhh...

*trolls: (still pitiful)..

(Back to Victim)

Administrator: (shine light to the reported)!!

Victim: Ugh, hh??..... hhh..

Administrator: (deserved to be banned, ban beam)!!!

Joel: `BAN BEAM`?!?! NO, NO MEME TEXT TODAY.

Victim: (burnt to the ashes)!!..... (skull collapse inward).

*trolls*: (very pitiful)...

Arn: We are currently facing tremendous amount of harassment campaign over the past few years. (Walk towards the demonstration ash)

*troll*: (stand up & follow) (some caries their beanie seat)

Arn: Irony here, and there. Amazing creators like him, must face and lose, as they lack support from various parties. Many of them think for themselves, and to any extent of opinion differences, and you just see now, conflicting theories, they react.

Yab: There are, [few](https://twitter.com/kobokanaeru/status/1632386025615167488?s=20 ). But so many than the *few* means all is useless. It should've been all.

Tab: As you can see. It's not just you had conflict. Pretty much it's all around us.

Arn: Trouble is, it often leads into this, (reached close to the ashes) way. Alot.

(And then float video player containg each callouts from Rev & Hero Hei & more)

(Float videos from [Rev](https://youtube.com/@Revsaysdesu ) & [Hero Hei](https://youtube.com/@HeroHei ) around them circularly, maximum May 2023)

*trolls*: (Look around)..

Vriska: (Looking one video float)..

Karkat Vantas: (looking)..

(Also switch back forth between one video and one troll ocassionally)

(etc.)

*saorfas* : sit on ground.

(Turn of floating videos)

*trolls*: (sit).

Arn: The reason I bringing you here is help this universe.

Yab: To make it the safe place for all.

Tab: free from any conflicts, coup d'etat, and wars, in a wake of just a simple and stupid disagreement.

Vriska: Wait, how do we do this? So we're doing online, to hack into their computer who is who, caught harrassing?

Joel: Hmm, notica**B**ly we lack `B` on average talk.. interesting.. 🅱️.

Arn: Great question. Since nowadays they are harder to track. Not to mention even the biggest crime hub center ever exist no longer accessible nor recallable through extreme means, that does not mean such crimes and its posts completely removed. They lie somewhere, lives among innocent, in plain sight, nobody can no longer track. Yet it keeps getting worse everyday.

Tab: People are very smart. And the evil ones will, jam our signal. No idea how to counter. And often times, strongest defense will always have holes, they know it first, keep on theirs, use to their advantages. Simply said, unviable.

Yab: Only things we can do now then, is to physically make big call towards them. As you can see, Polices around galaxies has notes on various criminals whose identity somehow captured. They had it all, but they're stuck, since they are impossible to track their whereabout. If this e.g. a Philantropist was actually, **the Impostor Among Us**. We are now tangibly playing games, figuring out who is who.

Arn: Because banning their account seems no longer enough. They can just switch and hack their MAC Address, and start anew, like nothing happened.

Tab: by physically capturing them, you have reduced the possibilty of such conflict, since they're the Brainware. More is better, more power and support to the Creators.

Terezi: SOO, W3 AR3 GO1NG TO B3 4 POL1C3?

(Put them in interpol Dasandim. If I am not wrong, the final credit is about just earth, humans, clones, trolls live together. Pls check. Idk what to do with Alternia then? Merged??)

Arn: Interpol. Intergalactic Police. You will have mission for certain time, and going to its place around the universe and help local police on your mission to capture every plain sight criminals.

Yab: I understand it is very rude to dox anybody lives. But right now, the universe is at wars. Beings are scronching each other for their own sake, and such disagreement. We will provide you every instrument that you need to track down these nasty criminals that hides in plain sight. And we have notified all polices around galaxies for your coming. They are now your allies.

Terezi: HUHH, 1 GU3SS TH4T'D B3 FUN, SL4SH AND SHOOT1NG 3N3M13S, 4M 1 R1GHT??

Arn: Not so fast. You are allowed to scronch the target.

*trolls*: (disappointed)

Karkat: (sigh)... THAT'S IT, I QUIT. (But there is no quit)?? (Change mind) OR MAYBE..

Arn: It's ironic, remember? The targets are scronching, threats, and convinces the victim to end themselves. You're the one that gives you opposing examples, that such bad behaviour is clearly a bad idea.

Tab: However it does not mean you stay full mercy. How about we have fun, still allowing you gamers to have riffle, e.g.

Arn: (show an AR style futuristic law enforcement machine gun) This will be your standard weapon. The Aduz, AD-U5. Just call this Aduz.

Yab: It looks like a modified training gun, to be used for chaos control. Well it is. But don't underestimate it's ammunition.

Arn: Inside this magazine can only be filled with a specially designed bullet, called.. Jotos. Yeah, `to punch` in Javanese.

Terezi: HUH, J4P4N?

Arn: No, Ja..Va. you know, Javascript, Java, Java Island, Jawa, not that Jawa Star Wars, it's.. Kaorfa's mother. She's from Semarang. Anyways, Jotos.

*trolls*: (repeat and learn word `Jotos`)

Yab: With this bullet, when it hits enemy, it feels like you've punched by Mike Tyson, you know who he is?

*trolls*: (gets it) ah yea

Yab: Basically it. Just 1 Newton hit multiplies 3 times. Calculate that later, but sure it's powerful, but non-lethal.

Tab: In fact it has been used once during a chaos in New Vedan.

## Cutaway Protest

(Protestester tried to break the fron gate of the government palace, swing gate back and forth)!!!

*raid law enforcement*: (aimed), (fire)!!!!!

*protesters*: (all Syncope)!....

(12 seconds later)

Officer Deuce Middle: (arrested the lead), (kick back leg)!, C'mon kid.

Foosch Rook: Geez!

## finish cutaway

Tab: It's versatile. Hit back neck vagus nerve e.g., equals hitting upfront, but from afar, and of course non-lethal.

Jade Harley: (very interested, anime big eyes)....

Arn: (bestow) There you go, Jade.

(You got Aduzkind)

Jade: wow.. :D thank you.. 

Yab: You forgor you had emoji right? On Windows it's `Win`+`.`, Linux Gnome has icon on top right, Android OneUI has smiley icon left top on your keyboard, etc.

Jade: wait, (thinking those shortcut).. (appeared) 🫨?!

Yab: Yep, everyone, You people have Emoji keyboard. You'll see this in the instruction we have just telepathied to you.

*trolls*: 😀🥰🙃🤗😗🤗🫠😇☺️🤨🫠😋😗🤗😉😚🤩😝😛🫡🤕🥸🤥🥸😌🥶🤮😷😶‍🌫️😎😶🥵

Tab: Okay, that's all for today, you may return to your house, tomorrow you'll be introduced with your office.

*trolls*: (have fun a while & go back home bit by bit)

Terezi: W3LL, S33 YOU LAT3R, FOLKS..

Jade: (aim at dummy through scope).. (fire).

(Dummy thrown away 20 metres)!!

Jade: whoah ho whow... wow!

Joel: Expression matter I guess. So punctuation is expression.

Arn: Train well. All gamers, for every role, are crucial.

Yab: Work together is the key.

Tab: Coordinate well, you shall prevail.

(Extra connect! As trolls have banished harrassment, the attackers got angery and banded together to attack Dasandim in revenge, becauss they are the best helper for all polices around galaxies. This leads to an age we called Dark Age, where Dasandim forced to install Anti Defamation law. It seems that capturing and prosecuting so many harrassers proven to be useless since more harrassers manifested and even worse and more impossible to track.)

(Extra extra! Post Defamation era, Polices went corrupted as every government around galaxies alas, filled with those harassers. Police weakened for the anti-defamation sector and likely basically. The ex Polices escaped established a new agency we know where Agent 47 rejoined this agency in A Hitman On Time / OpenScronch. Their goal is to eliminate the exact harrasser who overthrew the good people. Right, I think that's the way could be, whew!)

## Bonus

(Continue next day after resurrecting Vriska)

Arn: We are not finished yet.

Yab: I know right.

Tab: Shall we?

Arn: Commence. (async) (commence pull merging all homestuck elements, from 1, epilogue, 2, and more).....

Yab: (async) (also together)...

Tab: (async) (also together)...

........

...

...

(Stories are all here, surrounding into a sphere)...

Arn: Alright. Let's get to it.., (merge)..

(ERROR CONFLICT duar [deltarune explosion](https://youtu.be/o84vJH19toI ) & [bin cannon](https://youtu.be/Vu-UuWrHCqc ) at the same time & Saorfas thrown back 30 metres) 💥💥💥💥💥💥💥💥💥💥💥💥💥💥💥💥💥💥💥💥💥💥💥💥💥💥!!!

(then after that, Saorfas try to partially bend look front)

Arn: (hit) OEOUF!!! (leg up)!!!, (leg fell)!.., (look front again)... Huh?

(Red conflict ⚠️ triangles floating)

Yab: (also looked front) It appears, that there are some part of the commit had branches.

Tab: Hence those branch runs differently apart from each other.

Arn: Looks like we have to report this. We have no power nor ideas. Let Kaorfa cherry pick these.

Yab: Good idea.

## Bonus done

OK
