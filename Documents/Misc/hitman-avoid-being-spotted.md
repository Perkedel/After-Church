# Briefing
Johan Carl: Good evening, Chara. Your target is **Gomsye Abalaklar**. Fake artist, actually stole and edited people's arts. He not proficient in drawing, but expert at manipulating images he found online and even managed to stole over 6000 Photoshop files which he edited to change the look, remove original signature and sign himself.

Why then is it the big deal? Well, Gomsye did more than just stealing. He even threatened to end the original author's life too. and his traces somehow disappear, untold.

Gomsye always stays in his house at his penthouse where your destination is. He mostly stays in his studio room, so that's where to infiltrate.

Also, our client asked you to retrive the **USB Harddisk** where he put his crime in it. It's right next to him, and it only unlocks by his fingerprint, but, in event of his demise, one last fingerprint will permanently unlock it. You may also retrieve **his computer** too as well if you want, that would be better.

## Mission Active

and as always, **great luck**.
