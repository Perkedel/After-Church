# Takes

## Take 1
sometimes it didn't immediately update.
sorry for inconvenience. we got technical difficulty. pls wait.

sigh. uh. we have bad internet. the flutter could not connect. we are still holding these snapshot of database.

okeh. fine. it doesn't work. internet not work. let's just forget it and show next.

the android emu cannot connect.

if you see loading constantly, that mean the user id is no longer found in the wearer collection of this firebase database. we have only 2 documents of them.

ah I wish the internet work. so I can show you firebase immediately update.

wait. the snackbar should work.

## take 2
okay. other measures.

first, we must login. let's sign up to show you it's there appeared.

watch as the wearer collection should update now.

yay! it's updated! I'll make the edit profile screen soon.

we are going to uh... the Rental View!

if you see constantly loading owner name, that mean the user id is no longer exist in wearer collection. we have 3 right now. the item belongs to those whose been purged from this test. let's see from the one who exist.

that item belongs to Weher.

now let's add rental just like that with this Yest.

let me tell you, I should have used Android emu, but...

I think the internet of my ISP is high traffic at this moment. that's normal and unsurprising, considering I have been using COnsumer grade internet service provider. WFH means burden for those ISP. but Business ISP on the other hand is too expensive!

watch as the Rental Collection's documents appearing.

ah peck, here we go again. worst internet connection in this manner, blah blah ablahashdfliuhauoihfuoiaheuiogfghoiuaerhgouiaerhguoiaerh.

see. new rentals appears under this account. let's change them a little bit.

I tried my best not to angery unprofessionally.

there you go. the name updates. let's see those items. one of them.

oops sorry for the whatsapp popup. anyway. let's uh add to cart and uh, idk I forgot.

huh. it's not realtime for collection in collection. idk why. but here it is!

let's go to cart screen! oh wait. add more items!!! yess.

oh pls no! PECK!!!

just when I need it. it's disaster.

now there you go. cart screen with swipe to remove from cart and undo button. I still have diffculty for undo on the top right. I can only have the snackbar version. the one that pops from bottom with blue undo button. So,

now let me show you that, **KHOCHOC IS NOW ONLINE!!!!!**.

wait. 

oops sorry, I have written in wrong language today. sorry. I should use ID. but ok. I hope you understand EN. 

ini dia! 19 khochocs. install nox later. I use real phone!

what else...

now see the high score here!

yess. it is match with the firebase database. I also kept the local version for legacy purpose

so yeah.

TODO, so that's i'll do for the next. um yeah.

thank you for your attention. for those of you who still watched, thank you. because we have bonus content!

let's find out!

yep. I can only send password reset button to whom owns the email. no. I can't even see it. ask Google why cannot the firebase owner see someone's password. that's it. definetely can't see password.

not relevant to the project, but, let's enjoy the extra golf. yep. that's it.

unfortunately, the Xendit SDK only has Native Android and iOS, etc. etc. no Flutter one here for the moment. sadd. pls help.

also here are following repositories I have.

Ourwear https://github.com/JOELwindows7/ourwear_prototype

Hexagon Engine (not relevant to project) https://github.com/Perkedel/HexagonEngine 

Oh my God! my laptop is going to explode! See, 8GB ram is too small at all!

I want to buy PC parts!
