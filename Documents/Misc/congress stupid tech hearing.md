# Final Congress Questions

cutaway for Family Guy inspired

## Pre-cutaway

A: Yeah, you wish. If I got sued just by tiny little bit about privacy discrepancy I'd be bullied to death by those congress people who are typically tech illiterates whose children also even more stupid.

## Begin

Congress Johnson: Final question for you. this will be only `YES` or `NO` Question. Follow the instructions on each question & only answer with `YES` or `NO`. There is no such `in-between` or `gray area`. We shall begin.

Ghein Thomas: (cringe pinch face) ugh.....

Johnson: 1. Do you spy citizens of America? If there is any form of telemetry, even a portion, local or online, say `YES`, otherwise `NO`.

CEO Kyuhl Jacques: (mentally destroyed)!?!??!... .. `YES`.

Johnson: 2. Do you gave away any data to 3rd party? e.g. private or non-private data either identifiable or non-identifiable towards 3rd party such as advertising agencies, foreign government, software company, etc., for either algorithm optimization, functionalities, and Integrated APIs, etc. If there is any, local on online, say `YES`, otherwise `NO`.

Ghein: (fell his head towards the table)!!, (roll right little)..

Kyuhl: ... `YES`.

Johnson: Last question, 3. Is your software development involves forbidden countries? countries such as China, North Korea, Israel, any Africa. If you have contributors from these countries or unsure, say `YES`, otherwise `NO`.

Ghein: (ask guard quietly) Sir, Toilet pls?

Guard Hammer Jack: Sorry, sir. No getting out during final section.

Ghein: Damn it!

Hammer: language, sir.

Kyuhl: ... ... `YES`. (cry buffer overload)

Johnson: Thank you.
