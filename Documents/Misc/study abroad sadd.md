# Study Abroad Sadd

Family guy inspired moment

## Begin

Jack Ilmin: (internally) (sigh), here we go again. Studying in somewhere I have no idea. No papa, no mama,

Hermin Pelandas: (telepathically) (async) Why are you sadd? You should be happy, finally made it to outside country..

Jack: (internally) (async) (flabbergasted) ....... (await finish talk) I'm away from my family. Why happy? You got issues?

Hermin: (internally) Noo, I have no issues.

Jack: (internally) (silently) You sure?

Hermin: (internally) Okay, the teacher here is grumpy. But no, I dreamt to go out of nation and be useful. My dad also wished too, and wishes every family to study around galaxies.

Jack: (internally) Ugh... whatever..
