# This is not You Don't Know Jack fanfiction nor OpenJack episode!
But it's within same Perkedel Cinematic Universe.

Instead of using Project OpenJack / Triviatron whatever, this sketch is for another Jack fangames, [Salty Trivia with Candy Barre](https://haitouch.ga/me/salty). Another Open Source\* YDKJ clone. This frameworks also allows custom trivia episode through the [Modification PCK repository system](https://github.com/JapanYoshi/salty_data). Thought we have to reinvent wheels again, but then.. its assets. Only the code are Open Source, assets proprietary, you have to take it off for the modded trivia replace it with yours only. We gonna reinvent the wheel later.

# Begin
## Lobby
JOELwindows7: Isn't this gonna be exciting, coz we finally have it real, eh?

(funny commercials)
## Intro
(Logo)..!

Joel: Ahei, Dasandimian! Welcome to............ Oh wait. wait! we're in different brand? Oh yeah just rember, Man, I've been rehearsed months ago for that game to be modded, I mean my own wheel reinvention. Okay, soo.. (read prompt) Welcome to Salty Trrivvia with JOELwindows7, where H.. Questions are ridiculous but answers are serious! yey!!, I'm your host JOELwindows7 & I'll be here to guide you through... this rather unexpected meeting for today's video. Let's go!

(Player Bar)

Joel: So these are all gamers that we got. Alrighty then, Let me know if you had some funny feeling here, me too because here the branding are different from what it supposed to be. (Life Saver prompt) As you can see, instead of that power up that makes other player have extra difficulty we have what so called `Life Saver`. ... Yeah, Figured out this is a.. Takes 2 wrong answers off. Sorry, no copyrighted mentions in 1st episode before we secured stuffs, But this will let you answer later after 2 options gone. If other players didn't use `Life Saver`, you get to pick an option out of 2 after they picked out of 4. Yeah, you'll figure this out later, basically opposite of 2015 and it helps you, go later and others go first.. wait. yeah! You only had 1 out of dozen or 12, so use this strategically. Btw, it's not working for some special question type so keep that in mind. Right, let's get started!!

## Round 1
### 1 One. Who's dating Here?
Joel: Let's get started with, (category). Who's dating? Yeah, you already hear this alot. Right now I'm single, idk who would I take. Had one classmate before, 'course can't simp because that time my high school had policy. I mean c'mon, people fell onto this game, and heart broken everyday. Nah, I cannot have that, I did picked something else, and here I am. At a cost of something. well, let's not think about this, God should pick me one, I hope is what I envisioned, so..

> Imagine Sodium Chloride is an anthromorphic being that likes to date somebody **beautiful** in this day. What material should Sodium Chloride date & marry to make the day full of good examples & brings great guidances among Anthromorphimity?

Joel: Anthromorfimipi, anthro.. anthromofimi.. tee!, is it..

- Photon (answer). In Christianity, we've been taught to become Salt & Light for the world. Salt represents a good examples as an anthromorphics of bringing taste, & Light represents you guessed it, great guidance so souls don't get lost onto a bunch of random sins.
- Higgs Boson. (random fail sfx)
- Quark down spin. (random fail sfx)
- Potasium. (wtf boom)

Joel: You all already know if salt ever becomes.. tasteless.. Yeah no use than to be used as a stepping compound, lmao! Yeah, Serious. You should know. I wonder though, ever a salt literally becomes tasteless just like the bible said? Never hear such news, but ones that never told / usual is the people who became.. `tasteless salt`, yeah, gotta be careful folks. Don't let your philantrophy or whatever faith you believe in dies.

(comment: Photon-chan lol)

### 2 Two. When is the PC Parts?
Joel: Lemme ask you one more time, (category).

> If I have to satisfy my RPG life so that I can upgrade my arsenal and to be able to beat the boss at the end, which weapon blacksmith company should I trust?

Joel: is it...

- Circle Crop. Dell who has Alienware, despite starting into repairability for laptops might not get it really serious as of now.
- Scaffolders (answer). [Framework](https://frame.work), the first ever laptop company who's at the beginning applies repairability. Wielders of this weapon can grab a brand new & better parts smithed on an occasion basis allowing you to have great weapon enough to beat the final boss. The rest is your skill.
- Farmer Sights. Apple, Apple, Apple, Apple, Apple. Anybody who still had iPhone here? Why did you still use that? many of our software are not supported in any of the Apple product due to many.. you already know that.
- Fish Crackers. Samsung? Okay, anybody uses Samsung as their laptop too? Most of us here use Samsung as our smartphones. Who uses Samsung laptop? (This should be a sponsor; Samsung early days is Fish cracker before going Electronics)

(note: speaking of repairability, ask question about Fairphone too!)

Joel: Finally, a company that care with its owner. You already know when things, yeah just think about laptops for now. Anybody noticing laptops to began to be irrepairable or maybe just hard to find, its sparepart? Yeah you got that.

### 3. Three. Where is the 3D Model?! (Dis or Dat)
Joel: Right, (category). And oh boy.., It's Dis.. wait. ... Sorta Kinda!!!

(Dis or Dat / Sorta Kinda segue)

Joel: I'm going to give you 7 characters in here. Are these 3D models:

- Available to Download. OR,
- Unavailable to Download.

Joel: Think fast, you only have 5 seconds to pick between `exist` or `not found`. Not including reuploads, not including require join chat, and of course, you can't use `Life Saver` here. Begin, Great luck!

(Sorta = Dis; Kinda = Dat)

- Krystal. Dis. WarefareMachine (Victor Suarez)
- Shantae. Dis. Rafa Knight 
- Protogen. Dis. Nukude
- Bullied Blind Girl. Dis. popopoka_
- Glamrock Freddy. Dat. Lukasz Borges, requires join Discord. https://discord.gg/uGze6H9
- Ioniq Sky. Dat. JOELwindows7's own Skysona, based on Michael (bfwifesforever) & bbpanzu, haven't modeled yet, including the sull detailed IONIQ 5 gratis itself.

(lift most winning player up) (qualified models will be linked later on the sequel of this)

Joel: Great Job, Gamers!

(Logo hit finishes)!!

Joel: I've been hoarding 3D models here. So these are just few examples. Every model that is terminally not available publicly breaks my heart. Now if you have some questions or whatever it is about 3D model sharing, I don't have any yet. BUT, longue always opens at [our website 3D models room](https://perkedel.netlify.app/apps/3dmodels) yeah! Go check it out! there's instruction on how to contribute!

### 4. How do I climb this mountain?

Joel: This thing so high! (category)? Well, speaking of wielding weapons..

> I just remembered that I need the dagger as the key to open the beast heart open once I've defeated it. But that dagger is not in this island & is at the mountain somewhere! Which mountain should I climb?

- Kilimanjaro. Dude, or Dudette, or whatever. Manjaro's dagger is based on Arch Linux. Not the correct type specific for this beast.
- Everest. Who in the world thought to leave a dagger bare at the peak of the Everest (Nepal) that high? Everybody's conquering it! it would've been already gone 12 seconds before you even get started.
- Sacral Temple. uh... I don't think Mount Fuji has that dagger. It has been intentionally left in the open, and infact it's a volcano.
- Windy Peaks (Answer). [Fairphone](https://fairphone.com), is a phone company that also applies repairability, as well as other fair trade & work environments down to its material. This company was established & settled somewhere in Dutch, that we all know is Windy, full of Windmills.

Joel: Okay. let's be clear. I really wish these 2 companies sells in Indonesia. I don't want it to be constrained by the marketing & appeal cost here. It's matter. everything this is matter. I mean, with due respect to repair people out there, they also have that kind of stress here, hunting stuffs needed & also facing murder threats from those company they're fixing client's device on, yeah. No need to tell further, but just ask Louis Rossmann if you'd like to know more.

### 5. Why has to be that guy (Taper Jokes / Candy Trivia)

Robot: Here are retypes, no recovery. Pls buy Joel new PC parts to prevent this happening again

Joel: Once upon a time, we had this candy pack that each of the wrapper had jokes written on it. One example

> What Lizard causes stomach ache (Kadal apa yang bikin sakit perut)? Lexpired / Expired (Kadaluarsa)

(piano dum tss)

Joel: Yep, they got me. Speaking about Lizard,

> Supposed a furry convention center takes place at an entire planet scale. What costume design that would be considered Ultra Uber Rare?

(provided that convetino for entire planet)

Joel: Is it..

- Protogen. Umm no. This being is basically a cyborg or sometimes a synthetic being.
- Python. Mmm, this spam ham is yummy, is that right Lex?
- Manggarai (Answer). This brand new costume design is based after Komodo dragon. an endemic reptile species only found in Indonesia. Manggarai because the preservation site National Komodo Park, Komodo Island is located at District Manggarai, Nusa Tenggara Timur. This species is of course you guessed it, very rare & vulnerable.
- Bengkulu. Wait, are we having plant based costume design now? Wonder how does Rafflesia chan would look like.
