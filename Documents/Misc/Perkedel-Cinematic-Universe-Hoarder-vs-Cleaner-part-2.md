Liya: Hah! you lose words. Now what to do?

Jmerson: **AJREG;OIABEROUGNAERIUGBADPUIGHBAIULREWH!!!** Enough!! Let me do whatever I want, and **and you should not interfere!!!**

(Jmerson broke Liya's heart!)

Liya: Oh. My. God. ... ... ..., Jmerson. Ouch. You broke my heart. I have been dreaming this for years. I wanted this house to become as luxury as possible. I want this house to be free of obsolete junks, unlike my school friends who never clean their workstation to this day. I don't want anyone, ANYONE!, F8888888 ANYONE INTERFERE!!!... WITH me doing my business, to get this looks... appealing. Okay. Fine. that was a good shot. that hurts. I feel like,

Jmerson: sigh! you did it again. thinking to..

Liya: I would like to [get out from this universe](https://suicidepreventionlifeline.org/ ), go my spirit to somewhere else. What is it? I think.. [Puffballs](http://www.innersloth.com/ ), [Markus](https://minecraft.net ), 

Jmerson: No! STOP! **DON't!**

Liya: [Ale](https://yandere-simulator.com/ ).. No. uh, [Jonas](http://hatintime.com/ ),

Jmerson: [Stop it! get some help!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EdstMCqTJw8 ) you'll always get hell if you do this. you can't govern the Universe hub! it's egoistic state right now! that guy is too big for you to handle!

Computer: (rings)

Telmin Telolo: (pickup call). Yes? Franchise Resource Alliance.

Respondo Nado: Hey, Telmin, this is me, Respondo. I've just negotiated once again to the universe owner (Name here). Unfortunately Joel and his friend lost the game, and he didn't get anything at all. I guess we couldn't monetize this Hexagon Game, or forcefully had to hide that DVD for now. just to be safe.

Telmin Telolo: Oh, no. I have to tell boss. Chief!

Rimborn Gayarsaran: Yes?

Telmin: We lost. Joel and friend already tried their best, just ended nothing.

Rimborn: (Angery, throw phone to carpeted floor)!! Argh! peck those guys! pecking **proprietarist!** We'll get them once they (the company) all Eik Serkat (die, a.k.a. Bankrupt). what a bunch of stingy heads.

(back again)
Liya: ... what?! you don't want me to commit Eik Serkat? if you wish, we all end! **END END END!!** Once you get out work, you'll never see my door opens anymore.

Jmerson: Alriiight go ahead. Do it. As usual it won't happend will it? we'll see.

(Penalty, few months back)

(escorting Nielson like usual)

Nielson: I heard a LBRYian recently got arrested after months in Dasandim when she was on a cafe with her "boyfriend".

Jmerson: Oh, why?

Nielson: She deliberately divorced idk why, maybe she doesn't like him, and she literally cheated after that. Let me tell you. You can report or be reported for successfully divorcing. So, don't even talk about it. If you do, disperse before it's too late.

Jmerson: Oh, thank you. Yeah I'll make sure that doesn't strike me and mah-cutie.

Nielson: Great Luck!

(back again)

Jmerson: that's it! She's violation! I can revenge! yess! (go to car with junks in it) C'mon guys, let's go!

# Civil Separation
Jmerson went far from the luxury house and finds another empty spot. in between spot, he wrote borderline to separate Jmerson territory against now Liya's territory.

Jmerson then built a house again from scratch with help from brand new friends of hoarders. it's now build and it looks awful. A makeshift metal house.

Jmerson and friends agreed to establish this as a town.

Liya on the other hand, also decided to establish her area as a town.

Jmerson named this town Hoarder

Liya named this town Cleaner.

These two forts, are never friendly each other, but never went into war.

So, that's how Hoarder & Cleaner towns are here, fighting against each other.

Remind me, to arest Liya for deliberately divorcing Jmerson.

# Posta Nota
Hello gamers. This is JOELwindows7 again.

recently I've had family issues. I hate to share this recklessly like a teenager on Facebook blabbermouth their problem, but I have to write this before it actually happen. Yeah, kinda like venting the curse out using writing fictional story inspired from my own papa vs mama drama.

So, my dad is Hoarder, and my mom is Cleaner. it's clear. My dad likes to keep junks, take junk, and every junk. My mom likes to clean all old stuff away.

My dad recollect junks again. that disturb my mom alot. then the debate begins. it shocks me. Note the date, that it was 6th September 2020. And did you know, My dad actually recollect that same type of item, Battery Backup & this Brother old toner printer. yeah, that's right, he's stupid. tbh. UPS not working. and still newer toner printer still produced to this day for semi-modern offices on earth that still need paper, stupidly.

all threats gone by. I am shocked. really mentally shocked. it hurt my mental condition.

Long before I had thought about 2 types of fort like above. So now here I wrote, to *throw away* the upcoming curse of divorce and uh, you [know](https://suicidepreventionlifeline.org/ ).. yeah anyway.

I just don't want the same thing like that story above happened in real life of me. So I wrote this fictional story, and set the hope `Vent Curse` which is a hope to prevent bad devastating thing from actually happening in the future.

Maaf mah, papa, tapi aku takut ini kejadian beneran. maafkan aku.

That is all about it. thancc for watching. Great Luck, God Bless You. Stay Safe, Be creative.
