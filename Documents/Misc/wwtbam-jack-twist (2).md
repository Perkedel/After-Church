Tefold: He's the host here today.

Bill: Wait, are we still playing Millionaire or Jack?

Tefold: Millionaire, sir. We are experimenting mixture of the assets here today, because especially this guy seems very interesting if we brought him to the serious version of it.

Bill: Oh wow, that gonna be surreal. I mean, I am intrigued, just curious, why not someone else.. I mean, not to disagree..

Tefold: We're too lazy of course. You remember that.

Bill: Ah yeah, that's right. I've seen you on Odysee last week, very cool.

Vania: 60 Second!

Tefold: Okay, prepare yourselves. People, you ready?

Ana: Wow. It's been an honor to be one of the live audience here. Although in Dasandim, but well, honor is honor.

Colin Northward: You bet!

Bill: I've heard Millionaire distant years ago, on Earth it's a viral at its time. It's very hard, so few people win. I honestly lost my hope here. I'm afraid if I lose this too and uh.. you know.

Tefold: Don't worry, we have covered this. We'll try our best so at least you & upcoming participants can easily win.

Bill: Well, if you say so. Are you sure about that?

Tefold: We are.. should be sure. If, the game is hard, just so many not 1 million endings, we will lose audience. So, uhh not only the big stake is the trouble, but also win endings people are expecting. Therefore, that's where all the aids here's to it.

Vania: 15 second!

Bill: Okay.. I guess I.

Tefold: Semangat! Pantang nyerah! Just like you kept going despite being too hot everyday on your job.

And long story short, it is declared died a world. Luckily, Samsung always had backed up user's data except photos. the photos & videos luckily was covered by Google Photo at the time.

Cookie: Okay, if that's your call. anyway,... Don't go anywere, Stay for this one.

(Commercial break enter)!........

## Ad break
Bill: Ahhh yeah.

Cookie: Well, good job on you, because you are now in the second checkpoint. Are you excited for the Millionaire?

Bill: How it won't be? But yeah. Seriously nervous. Also btw, I could easily go with those questions here. I am really suspicious, Is this intentional or uh... Somebody couldn't find the one that makes the answer over ready?

Cookie: Umm yeah, I thought that too. Gerald?

Gerald: Umm, idk, We are here for the experiment you know. Perhaps.. should be the easy first, to see if uh you know. Audience would like to hear this. Beside, I've been hearing bank news these days, people are and has been satisfied with just the way this UBI works. If you can't have it, just wait. Honestly we're not interested having money here, just the item. Luckily we have something that emulates it and evaluate if we need it or not.

Cookie: Wow, that's a good answer. You have UBI here? how does this work?

Bill: Uhh simple. it applies for everyone. every month we're given 100000 Kvz, freshly minted.

*audiences*: Oooooooo

Cookie: Wow, then you don't have to play this game? do you? Just wait serveral months and you'll have 1 million.

Bill: One condition though, uh eeh. You must be humble, I mean. If government caught you being stingy e.g. uh.. especially from what I heard most of the time, published the app or game.. anything like proprietary, or not gratis, or not full version a.k.a. one of the DLC is paid, uh listen DLC is okay, all must 0 Kvz too. Yeah if any these 3 then.. your UBI will be revoked, forever.

Cookie: ouuu, ssssssssüò¨üò¨üò¨üò¨üò¨üò¨üò¨..

Bill: But don't worry, just repent, don't do that again, reGratis, republish, and reGratis all DLCs, and the 10 years laters, you'll get your UBI back.

Cookie: Dude, that's a freakin' long time.

Bill: Yeah. That's why you don't dare challenge the government for your own greed. it's painful. Not to mention your lifespan isn't gonna be forever, who knows you die when without the UBI. In Dasandim you'll be scrounging hard to make your ends meet, because also, government stipulates the workplace has to also shame them as same as the punishment status.

Cookie: Owww. If I may ask, how much reduction company has inflict to them?

Bill: 95% of the current salary, even if your own company made revenue out of those 3 greed, you have to pay fine to the government 95% & minimum some Billion Kvz per payday depending how long have you been doing this. If you don't have enough, you'll be jailed, alive until you repent then 10 years after declaration. Yeah. When you know it, you know it's the bad idea for ever.

*audience*: (fear)...

Bill: Well, you can download the manual on Dasandim website. check it out.

Cookie: Okay, thank you. That's so scary.

Bill: So, there you have it. I'm sorry folks, this is scary for you, but this is what we have been, and sorry I am agree with this. Because I hate expensivism, proprietarism, and partialism. You dared, instant poor. Okay, is it done? We went political on this.

Cookie: Not yet.

Tefold: 1 minute 30 second remaining, sir.

Gerald: Buddy, I just have a feeling here. Uh.. You got it all, but I feel like.. the last one would be harder here.

Cookie: Is they question can be spoiled?

Gerald: No, either software design or what, the untouched questions are encryped. each and everyone, layer by layer. It'll be downloaded on demand, which explains this internet connection requirement here.

Cookie: Wow, so secure. Well nobody could leak that, I supposed. But wait, isn't that a violation?

Gerald: No no, the question & the keys will be published after the game, so you can replay this again & again. That's how it works.

Cookie: Oh, okay. Coz that's a double standard if not.

Gerald: Yeah, don't worry, we've already considered everything.

Tefold: 1 minute!

...

...

...

...

Bill: I'm seriously worried here.

Cookie: C'mon, you did your best! Don't break a sweat buddy.

Bill: Yeah man. I just hate losing. It... breaks my heart.

Cookie: Me too! Yeah, We don't like losing. But hey, you have thirty two thousands in your pocket. Guess what can you buy those with? A sport car? yes!

Bill: No man, I'm not interested with that. I like... mmm Augers. That can drill the fast.

Cookie: (thought it costs billion Kivrontz) Oh. I'm sorry.

Bill: Well, our government has.. the drill that digs about 30 Km an hour. We wish we could get the world's fastest one, that goes 60 an hour. It's expensive. Uh, it was being sale in Sloantim mall. Other diggers from galaxies had it. Why don't we.

Cookie: Hey, be patient. One day you'll get it. (attempting to speak Bahasa Indonesia).. Se mah ngg aat!!!

Bill: Oh, wow, thancc man.

Cookie: Sorry, did I butchered it?

Bill: Not bad. keep it up, just little needs fluency.

Cookie: Thank you. Hey, What language you guys speak?

Bill: Dasandimian speaks 2 languages. English & Bahasa Indonesia. We thought of adding Hebrew because we were created after Jesus risen up, but it seems no demand unfortunately.

Tefold: 30 Seconds.

Cookie: Oooh, then how you speak the first time your ancestor created?

Bill: Just telepathy. like.. nerve controlling limbs. no language. I guess the angel don't want to complicate the process, and he wanted to try no speak being but just a telepathy.

Cookie: and how did you get language?

Bill: Spying. have giant telescope & audioscope, we happened to look over west & east, few in the middle. the English is west, and east is Indonesian. and in about 1965 ish, that's where the assimilation began, we invited that Earth humans to have tour and uh.. .. That's

Cookie: It's okay.

Bill: We tried incest. fail absolutely. That's why we got neighbours. And finally it includes human.

Cookie: Oh, okay.

Tefold: folks, get ready 15 second.

Bill: Hokay..

Cookie: Okay, Bill. don't panic, must relax. Drink up first. (sipp a drincc)

‚úÖ 250000 Kvz! Panadol relieves headache only. And speaking of UHUK UHUK, yes that's right. there was a scandal once upon a time involving this code for the cheat.

### 14. Which text editor is not Fully Open Source?
- A. Vim
- B. Visual Studio Code
- C. Nano
- D. Geany

Bill: Wow okay. all of these had source code. Except 1 thing. *Not full open source*.... B, VScode. Final Answer

Cookie: Is that your final answer?

Bill: (checking).... Yep, B.

...

...

...

‚úÖ 500000 Kvz! in Visual Studio Code, there are proprietary blobs for Official builds. Marketplace, LiveShare, & Remote. This is considered a violation of Partialism technically since it is those feature that are not included in the repository. Yeah, some not available, paid / private DLC, even you get it for $0 & included right out of the box, but if there is no public source code to all of those, still Partialism. This is why Marketplace in AUR version of Code is not as full as official Microsoft's one. the Marketplace is different.

Cookie: Anything else?

Jake: Or if not sure & hopeless, try where Kaorfa lives, it's Eastern, so C.

(times up)

Cookie: times up! Between C or D.

Bill: Okay. C or D. That's still not convince me to either.

Cookie: Okay. You can just... bring 500k. not bad! perhaps maybe you can use it to maintain your auger for much longer. beside, if it works, don't fix it, lots of engineer says so.

Bill: Yeah. But hate outdated technology.

Cookie: Okay, maybe you can buy yourself uh.. Video games? like what collection did you missed?

Bill: I don't intend to collect some now, I have no idea.

Cookie: Well think that later. So technically, either walk away or lose with available hearts no matter what wins you 500000 Kvz, which will always be in your pocket. Relax, half is not bad.

Bill: I gotta bills to pay too aswell.

Cookie: what is it?

Bill: Nothing essential, 100% are subscriptions to films. Look, I got friends and even my children watching paid streaming movies. I know, I could get them from X0p1r4t3, but uh.. I am not comfortable and it's very late to get them sparsdated.

Cookie: Okay. Well, take anything you'd like. 500 K always.

Bill: (palm wrap face & bow depression) (sigh)!.... Okay. Kaorfa lives.. in Eastern Jakarta... aand... he must've gone somewhere... Parks, Games, rides, Waterbooms maybe, srhrvf vrrRerRfffffqqqqqhhh... Take Eastern Jakarta C...
