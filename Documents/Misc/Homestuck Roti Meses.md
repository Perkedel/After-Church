# Make me Roti Meses

Family guy inspired gag moment

## Begin

(Imaginary gag)

JOELwindows7: Okay, Condesce.

Condesce / Betty Crocker / Meenah Peixes: what?

Joel: Make me `Roti Meses` (Chocolate sprinkled sandwich).

Meenah: ... bulls888, i do not take orders. i make orders.

Joel: ...

Meenah: (felt obliged)??, no.. no.. NO!!

(Joel deadly flat stares)

(Fuschia blood lol, Google Fuschia, Google Nest hub)

Joel: (deadly flat stare) ðŸ™‚......

Meenah: (can't help but make Kaorfa the `Roti Meses`) (immediately blaze go to bread station)!!!! (Take bottom bread), (spread Blue Band fully), (sprinkle Ceres Milk edition from its sprinkler tube)!! !! !! !! !! !!, (hold new top bread), (spread Blue Band to the top bread full), (blaze back to Kaorfa) `)(`-ER-E (Give like giving date letter)!!!..

Joel: (take) Thank you. (Consume)..

Meenah: hh... h.. how.. how did.. what did you do?!?!?

Joel: I don't do anything.

Meenah: buh...buht....

Joel: You're [Fuschia](https://mspaintadventures.fandom.com/wiki/The_Condesce ). Google Nest Hub.

Meenah: (turns into Google Pixel Tab 2023 sitting on its included stand, the next frame camera looked at her)?!?!?!?!? (Muffled) AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!!!!!!

Info: Note, only actual Nest Hub & third party Nest Hub are Fuschia. Google's new Pixel is still Android with Nest Hub docked lockscreen. We decided to go there instead for later use.

## End

Still thinking Fuschia a highest caste? Think again.

Okay sorry that was too dark, but look, it was Google's idea!!! I don't know anything!!! I can't help myself with these coincidences!!!
