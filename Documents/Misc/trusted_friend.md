Is a Dasandim initiative to help somebody across galaxies, protecting and caring them.

It has been disbanded in 1947 Earth time. During the organisation lifetime we have helped over thousands of people. But that includes 3 cases. We accidentally helped one of the worst creep across galaxies.

I mean, we already best our mind reading power & skill, penetrating potential client's head and figuring their thoughts before we mark them eligible to be protected from unfair and murderous governments and mafias. Yet, somehow, there's just a few slew of them managed to encrypt and even make it impossible for us to even found any single point that is considered illegal. Not found, we just went and one day, a thought we could read slipped. It's shocking, how the peck did we missed it? We slowly disappear and ghost the client like a scammer. But that no longer solve anything, whole life. We must throw these angels far far away, to prevent them from being hunted down. Coz if they found, no explanation will convince the law enforcers, of any galaxies than us ourselves.

We lost 3 angels, no know where are they now. Perhaps they died. Hopefully old death.

Confirmed, they are all died age. But don't worry, all of their generations will be brought back to Dasandim.

No, during their exile whole life, the ex supervisor secretely supplied food. Thankfully, they have taught themselves how to farm foods and they're all standard fuel like human's or compliant, contains carbohidrate and others. We of course like mentioned before, gave them wife for each. These 3 wives are from different planets of course, each takes one exile across different location where each of the angels are now. That's it, we never hear them again. And when we revisited it, it's already all civilizations.
