# Treegate

A city sit next by Beanstalk city. This is a city that lines from north pole (beanstalk), towards south pole. This clever giant brush cleans up the air as Dasandim planet spins. The CO2 winds convert back to O2 at it passes through.

This explains why exhaust hole goes to west & oppositely intakes from east. As Dasandim spins as way the Earth spins (sun from east) & To naturally catch the wind and exhaust the dirty wind without extra fan needed. Then the exhaust should hit the Treegate and cycle goes on and on. Additionally, intake hole heights much higher on surface than exhaust due particle property, dirty goes down, clean goes up. Like water with sediment on bottom.

Of course, just having only brush isn't enough. That's why on various places around these exhaust there are cleaning trees, and sometimes sticking up to the tree directly.
