# ~~Under construction~~ Will have updates
We are building the rules. updates at some point in time.

# Rules
Make sure your ModPCK are
- Gratis. set price to 0 LBC.
- Open Source. Have source code and is accessible in description, **AND License is anything Free Culture compliant**. that includes the assets too, they shall not has `ND`, `NC`, and anything that forbids any freedom of stuffs. And you also have to include project files for every assets in your source code repository or if you prefer separate repo, provide additional repository containing your asset project files. exception if the asset comes from 3rd party (which then you must credit **with page link URL**)
- Full version. Is not demo to your paid full game, Real actual full game right ahead, for free. That even include the DLC as well (you can separate it but still has to be $0). Even for existing Godot Game(A).

(A) for existing Godot game, **You can still keep your** Steam, Itch, GameJolt, Google Play, or whatever app store paid if you wish. In here at Hexagon Engine Game Store, your ModPCK must be $0 (0 LBC) or it will also be marked `Illegal`.

Violation to any above marks your publication `Illegal`.

# `Illegal` ModPCK
Illegal ModPCK are marked when any of the rule above are violated. **They are not removed or even deleted** not only because nature of LBRY blockchain, but also prevent dystopic rejection syndromes. They just do not shown by default at
- Homepage
- Search Result.  
User can enable view `Illegal` ModPCKs at any time temporarily (turn on `Illegal` one filter to include them in result) or permanently (set default search filter setting, tick checkbox the `illegal` one). enabling this inclusion is not recommended.

To unmark your ModPCK not `Illegal` simply repent your project publication configuration to comply with rules above, and update the post / claim again. Sometimes you may need to contact Perkedel so we can see if you repent.

# Special filters
## Kamatussa (default OFF)
ModPCK or Designer that does not like 69420. This mark applies to Designer (user) or ModPCK (claim) that are notorious for being kamatussa (alergic with not suitable for wumpus such as R34 69420s).

Gamers can report users that either have been here in Hexagon Engine or even outside that are notorious for hating anything lewd. When the artist is confirmed to hate 69420, they'll be marked this tag and they'll lose `Get Featured` rights by default.

Designer that got marked this can complain to us and we'll happily remove the mark **IF** from now on to accept and embrace 69420, especially their original assets. So yeah, if you don't like your OC lewded expect your claim posts from ModPCK to stuffs not popular at all. You might then have to buy yourself advert slot yourself, we won't help anyone kamatussa here.

## DMCAd (default OFF)
ModPCK that are lightly got Copyright Strike only from Hexagon Engine store side. This mark applies to ModPCK that got DMCA complain from those.. yeah you know, creativity destroyers. Or.. that would get one despite the best effort that all ModPCK absolutely classifies as a fan art, game mods, you got the point.

Gamers can turn this filter ON to show ModPCK that has been copystriked or potentially can get copystrike. e.g.

Potentially will copyright strike no matter what
```
Copyright Dystopia: Contains elements that are come from Nintendo. Nintendo is notorious for copystriking especially but not limited to Fan games.
```
Yeah Nintendo, stop not would they.

## Guro (default OFF, requires NFSW)
ModPCK that contains gores, and blood stuffs. this doesn't need explanation.

## Horror (default OFF)
ModPCK that is horror, ans scary. again, everybody knows this.

it's category supposedly but sometimes out of that in somewhere will have horror surprise deceivingly I guess.

# FAQ
## I have commercial games on Steam page! do I have to discount them 100%?
No need to. You only have to discount 100% permanently **on this Hexagon Engine Store (yes, in the LBRY blockchain, you post through Hexagon Engine publisher or Odysee or LBRY Desktop app)**. You have to make your publication 0 LBC no question asked, and you also **have to** post all DLCs you have (if available), all for 0 LBC so that both your ModPCK & DLC ModPCK won't be marked as `Illegal`.

## I have this ModPCK for 0 LBC but the DLC ModPCK are not 0 LBC. what will happen?
your main ModPCK will be `Illegal` as well as those DLC ModPCK.

## I have standalone EXE files posted in LBRY for pay, but the same full but ModPCK version is 0 LBC. is this illegal?
Currently we accept this that just the ModPCK that has to be $0. However, this is still in debate, therefore you may decide to also make the standalone EXE for $0 unlike in your Steam page. So, no, it's not `Illegal`. for the time being.

Remember, **we currently only enforce this for ModPCK**, not standalone Godot game EXE at the moment.

And of course, make sure that ModPCK **is not Demo version**. The same full version, like when you buy it legit on steam, minus stealing parent's credit card lmao XD! serious, this is not just a joke, it's real.

## Why your Steam / Google Play / App Store page of your Hexagon Engine is paid? (*pressume availability*)
We are experimenting if this wicked way of milking maybe good for health & to compensate terrible suggestions from pitiful-a's customers (`why not you sell it? how do you supposed make money just by donation? what if your hardware business fail? what if the stonk or most passive income fails?`). We understand that this is a betrayal to Perkedel's motto (which is `Gratis`). Okay, and most importantly, that's because posting there **costs money**, anything that >$0 means alot, `costs a fortune` I'd say.

and Google Play... we need to prove legitimacy. people are instantly sus when APK is not from Google Play (despite lol sometimes a malware may slip through but again that's if you are reckless finding app). Okay, uh... well uh 1 account costs just $25 permanent, and those Open Source apps are $0. It's shameful and irony to make it paywalled so let's just be a cool guy $0.

However, that Steam or whatever app store version is nothing at all. just the same version with Achievement and workshop (Not recommended). You can still get the exact same for $0 as usual through everywhere, this Odysee, AUR (if we can make it there). You just buy the Steam Achievements & Workshop. And hey why would you do that anyway? you're wasting money for this one. We have our own Achievement and Workshop (LBRY) is absolutely is $0! thancc to LBRY inc. for providing us the power we needed to post all ModPCKs for Free (technically, because you watch video and get reward, tips, and stuffs) and uh wait. Cloud Achievement... okay that one is another story, we will provide the system ourselves.

and yeah we do not have Steam page for now and is low priority because it's pecking expensive man! Plus, you must make sure you paid license to those hungry beasts over there (assets that are copyrighted) OR if forcedly we must remove them out for that version which is a suicide for certain circumstances.

## Can I have copyrighted music in the ModPCK?
Absolutely! We don't care. There's alot of stuff back in the golden age days like [Newgrounds](https://newgrounds.com ) that does it this, Right? Yeah, [abundant examples](https://www.newgrounds.com/collection/henrystickmin ) and I can't count them anymore.

I mean it. **whatever here should be considered as a fanart, fan game, whatever fan things**. Indie flash game but it's Godot. DMCA shall not touch anything here! period. Newgrounds still stand to this day full of copyrighted music usage, well in range of Fair use man! but you get the point.

Oh. that reward and tips thing? hah you mad. C'mon at least it's not paywalled like said. it's the Odysee LBRY nature. It's not a blatant repost at all if that is not one but a quality fanart game thing!.. yeah. So shut up, why not go back to your usual day busting those bad Odyseenauts here that only does reupload videos from YouTube, TikTok, etc. without credit sauce? Just get lost, DMCA!
