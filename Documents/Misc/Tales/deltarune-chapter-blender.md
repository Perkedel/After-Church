(come out of car)

Bradley Hurrey: (show the way towards the circus camp).

Susie: Huh. It's empty.

Bradley: Sorry, ma'am, the circus has finished weeks ago, we did not disassemble our camp immediately on purpose just for you. Come, right this way.

Rhetorique Ulyorr: Follow me!

(camera view towards the camp)

## Enter the mysterious camp
(entered the camp)

Tolls Ruro: (turn on lamp).

Bradley: Alright, here we are. This is the spot.

Tolls: (Open curtain to reveal the secret teleportation device)!

Bradley: Kris, and Susie will go to here and we will send you into the realm. Your mission is to upload the `Important` message to the internet. When you're done, we'll receive the receipt and this (show picture frame of SD card) SD card will be in your hand. I need to keep this for one day another mission later. But now,

Tolls: (prepare teleportation)

Bradley: I want the world knows, that this universe is in crisis. We lack the `form`. So Kris, Susie (pat Kris & Susie), ... Great Luck, and God Bless you.

Susie: Will there any big monster like we do before? Bigger or smaller?

Bradley: We never know. Yesterdecade it was smaller, but they're growing so fast. Impossible to defeat, too much and we lack people to help us, so we must tell the world, now.

Tolls: (prepared teleportation) Brad! It's ready.

Bradley: Alright, people. Once again, Take care, Great Luck, and God Bless you all.

Susie: Don't worry about it, I guess. Kris?

Kris: (follow Susie into the teleporter carousel chamber)

(You & Susie have entered the machine that will bring you into an unknown dimension. Wonder what would that be)

Rhetorique: (close door)! Door's closed.

Tolls: Okay, people. Destination, Blender Meme World.

Rhetorique: You sure this is safe. Going there changes your form into lowest poly of all. Would we lose the feel of our limb or heartbeat?

Tolls: Not at all. According to my experience there, I indeed felt weird, but other than that, I can go back and take normal me body.

Rhetorique: Alright, whatever experts says.

Tolls: Alright going in in 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, Let's Go.

(Teleport Open & enter the Blender meme world), (floor open)!

Susie: Alright, Kris, Let's go!! (jump flip), (fell pose) woo hoo!

Kris: (also follow Susie fell pose)

Susie: Ah yess, just like old times.

(suddenly, taking form of a sample 3D model)

Susie: Wait, my hand! (look hand), HOAAA (hand becomes low poly)!!! What the? (turning into low poly) Oh NO! WHAT'S GOING ON?! Kris??!

Kris: (fell weird on their head)

Susie: YOUR HEAD!!! YOU TURNING INTO MONKEY!!!

Kris: (head is enlarging)? (body & limb disappear leaving just the monkey head)

Susie: OH MY GOSH!! YOUR BODY IS GONE!!! (felt another weird) Uh oh! (entire body turning into a box) I BECAME... (Texture disappear leaving the purple color on it) WHAA?? A BOX!?!? (and spun as airflow dynamic coincides it) ARGH!!! YOU GOTTA BE KIDDING ME!!! AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!!!

(and that's the dive)



# Blender Meme World
## Entry Point
(Kris & Susie awake in a plain bright plane)
Susie: (awake). Ugh, ... hmm, ... (attempt to stand up), ... AH! Stupid box me!! (push again, and it work) UGH! (stand upright finally) HOof! Hokay. Right, now. ... what now? Guys?

## Meanwhile
Tolls: Kris & Susie finally made it safe.

Bradley: Thancc God! YESS. Right, tell them the direction (spawn arrow), The Wah Tower should not be too far.

Lesley Mekan: Hands off the thingymagic boys.

Bradley: Ouh! Lesley, haha! Didn't expect to see you.., (turn around & draw Benelli M4 M1014 retractable stock whew that was detailed lmao) bastard üò°!

Lesley: (but has Laser Railgun) Remember, people always have to pay for people's masterpiece.

Bradley: You know, it's not fair to kill somebody with a weapon designed to pierce armor while they not armoured. It's out of balance.

Lesley: Oh this (point to railgun)? Nooo I don't need to kill any of you. Instead, (point to the Teleporter engine, & charge)! (Shoot)!! ZOINK!!!

(Giant laser orb runs slowly but extremely too powerful)

Bradley: Not so fast! (insert emergency strong barricade round from the emergency clip), (shoot into the laser orb pathway)!

(Strongest barricade formed)! (Giant Laser orb went straight through it like butter)!

Bradley: WHAT THE??!?!

Lesley: HAHAA YESS!!!

Tolls: OH NO! I GOT TO STOP IT! (Go to the teleporter engine to get it out of the way)

Bradley: Watch out! it's too dangerous!

Tolls: Alright, (unscrew mounting screw) Ugh, c'mon! 

(Giant Laser Orb is going too close)

Bradley: TOLLS!!! GET OUT OUT!!!

Tolls: (gave up and away)!! OOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!

(Giant laser orb finally hits the engine)!

Tolls: (run away) nonononononononono

(Teleporter engine going to explode)... (Duar)!

Lesley: OA!!!! ARGH, my leg! (saw glass stabbed his leg) UGH!, (point angrily towards Bradley) This is your fault! You should've dead by now!

Bradley: üòê (show force field).

Lesley: WHAT!? You cheating!!! (stand up) UGH! I'm going back next time. And remember, you must pay to get. Boys, let's go!

(Expensivists left)! (Rhetorique & Tolls run towards Bradley)

Rhetorique: Brad! you okay?

Bradley: Yeah, I'm fine. Whew.

Rhetorique: Aw, man. The teleporter is destroyed. Everything gone. Now they got stuck there, and will think that we're scammer. This is bad. What do we have to do?

Bradley: ... Go home. (take picture of the incident)

Rhetorique: Whoah? I mean, using the..

Bradley: Exactly. No matter where we go, Expensivists always can find us. We wanted Kris & Susie to be here locally and easier to access. Well, I guess it's not hurt to introduce them our home. Tolls?

Tolls: Transportation ready. How, Lesley could've destroyed this too.

Bradley: Expensivists only care about money, not fans.

Tolls: Alright. weird. Come in..!

(all 3 scientist get into the car), (head back to airport to go back to Dasandim)

Bradley: Huhh.. (Chat with the cleaning department), (say)

Our spot got compromised. Clean them up before anyone scrap it out! (send location & photo).

Bradley: Right, report sent. We gotta be quick, they should come by about 3 days with Zoblatos as a guide.

(smartphone ring)

Bradley: (pick up) huh? Hey, Bradley here. Who was (off the handle).. Lopi?

Lopi Cling (Dasandim Visceral Cleaning Alliance): Hey, listen. I think we have problem in your mission now. We should call Migrator to take Susie's & Toriel's house now to Dasandim.

Bradley: Whoah, so fast. But.. that requires approval! (reminding who are Kris & Susie from what game) uuh... Toby Fox. The dog!

Lopi: Well, unfortunately there's no time. We've detected an Expensivist we happen to track, smelling towards.. Kris' house. In real time

Bradley: Okay. Get them there. And you, clean the up. Don't forget, remove pheromones.

Lopi: Copy that.

Bradley: Great Luck, God Bless you. (close call).

Zoblatos: Oh yes, my name is Zoblatos. I'm an explorer here. How about you?

Susie: I'm Susie. And this is Kris.

Zoblatos: Nice to meet you. Zoblatos, and that Suzanne is Kris. Okay.

Kris: ...

Zoblatos: Kind of silence guy, is he like this?

Susie: Yeah, that's what he is. Wait a second. What did you say? "Suzanne is Kris"?

Zoblatos: Ah yess. I have to tell you now. When you entered this world, you'll take shape of primitives that are built in with Blender instead of dedicated 3D model. üò¢ and yeah, this world is a mess, I'll tell the story later but spoiler alert, We are in Crisis. 

Susie: Can you please explain, why Kris looks like floating monkey face? What about me?

Zoblatos: (deploy mirror) Your form is Default Cube. and, that monkey is called `Suzanne`. Sorry if the nameing confuses you. Should I just call that `monkey` instead? nvm, I got your name.

Susie: üò≤... Whoah.. okay. That's weird.

Zoblatos: It is. and it's bad. That's why we want you here. I want you know this message, clear, but it's in long adventure. So, we should go to my home.

Susie: Okay, where is it?

Zoblatos: I cannot tell the location right here, the IMFERNA will hear us. But, I have another solution. Hug me.

Susie: Hug, you? mmm okay I guess.

Kris: (hug Zoblatos)!

Susie: You sure you're not sus?

Zoblatos: Trust me.

Susie: Well, afterall won't hurt I hope. (hug Zoblatos)

Zoblatos: We shall commence. (run teleport to the Zoblatos' house)!

Susie: Hey, you reminded me of Ralsei. He likes to hug people.

Zoblatos: Thancc for your compliment. Big shoutout to Ralsei for teaching me this ability.

Susie: Wait, Ralsei?

## Zoblatos' house frontyard
(Arrive)! (release hug). (in the woods like environment with wood cottage house)

Susie: Whoaa... Well...

Zoblatos: Welcome to my house. Come in. have a seat.

Susie: Kris, c'mon!

## Inside house
Susie: Wow, so cozy.

Zoblatos: It is. (saw Ralsei) Ah, There you are.

Ralsei: Hey guys!

Susie: üò≤?! You are a... teapot?

Zoblatos: Ralsei takes form a teapot. Utah Teapot, specifically. another sample 3D model.

Ralsei: Hey guys, check out my new Tea here (show tea).

Susie: (immediately take it)!, OH YESS. (drink immediately)!!!

Zoblatos: Careful, it's still hot! 2 minutes remaining.. oh, ...

Susie: (analyze taste) (ncap) (ncap) (ncap).... mmm, not bad. it's great actually.

Ralsei: üòÅ

Zoblatos: Kris, would you like to try too?

Kris: (accept tea).

Zoblatos: (give cup of tea) here you go, please wait, cool down in 1 minute 20 seconds. Would you like for me to cool it immediately to ideal temperature?

### Choice
#### Wait.
Zoblatos: Okay. Well, we should now take a seat to... that sofa there

#### Immediately cool to ideal (BEST)
Zoblatos: Okay. Hang in there (cooling down to ideal temprature).. Done.

Kris: (drink the tea).

Zoblatos: How does it taste? (reading mind of Kris)

(You told Zoblatos that it is delicious)

Zoblatos: Yeah, That's right gamers. They said it.

Susie: Whoa what was that?

Zoblatos: Oh. well, we should take a seat. Now it's time.

## Take seat
<!--
idea nate
- tell story
- 3D model file are paywalled
- hence Kaorfa wants to do it himself 
- He got all the necessary resources
- but
- JOELwindows7 the Kaorfa has trouble starting to sculpt
- Susie ask why didn't he able to start
- zoblatos say Joel lacks motivation & is nervous. zoblatos cannot understand why though
 -->

Ralsei: So, what's the plan here?

Susie: You said that we're invited to a mission or something. Yea what is it?

Zoblatos: It begins when Kaorfa was crusing the net.

# The Tale of 3D Model Collection
Zoblatos: He likes technology. He likes collecting stuffs, assembling and making stuffs, and anything with Technology. 
e.g. collecting 3D models. everything he find. One day, he stumbled upon one of a kind.

It's beautiful. Of course, he will take it. However, there is hurdle. it's the price.

`Unlock with $10 Tier` `$30` `$300` `UPFRONT`

The license restrictions

`All rights reserved` `No commercial use allowed` `No NSFW` `No edit`

The partialism

`FREE = model` `$5 = model + animations`

It is bad. Many people has to face the reality and forcedly has to fall into what it's called, The `Lowest` in order for us to live.

and have form.

Kaorfa had an idea to rebuild everything himself as he runs solo. He knows everything he need to get started. He also know how to execute the idea into reality. But there is a trouble. A huge trouble.

He is nervous. lack motivation. no idea where to start and where to go. Despite everything he learns from the net, nothing that gives the confidence as they are just tutorial videos.

Kaorfa then decided to embark on the initiative called `Collective Assets` instead which basically find existing assets that also anyone other than Kaorfa can use. With no restriction or any limitation whatsoever.

Alas, he could only find a pinchful, or zero at all. So much dystopia, Kaorfa forgot what did he got after all this time collecting if any of them he find happens to be `Collective Assets` compliant. No, he said. He lost all hope, and decided to

`Surrender`.

# End tell tale
Zoblatos: And here we are. The result of how bad those sculpters that never give download link. Or if so, many requires us to give them monet in order to acquire. I don't think noone will like how do we look. Nor any of us around here. We're just, a sample model.

Ralsei: Aw.. Don't be sad. Come here, let me hug you.

Zoblatos: Thancc. But I have no idea how this cope will last. To be honest, everything we seek to cope never last over 30 seconds. Then everything back to normal.

Ralsei: Come on, you don't look bad. I like your look. You look awesome!

Zoblatos: Thancc. By the way, my form was an experiment Kaorfa conducted, to seek for sleek look of a typical female. And this.. is what he got. He had no idea what to conclude about this, so he decided to give everything he randomly chose to me. So, don't be surprised if I am indeed male judging by what voice you hear right now. Although, There are some female zoblates with similar look too.

Susie: Okay. by the way, who's Kaorfa?

Zoblatos: Great question. Kaorfa is the founder and owner of this Cinematic Universe. His name is Joel Robert Justiawan a.k.a. JOELwindows7. He makes everything here. Though, to be honest most of these are assembled from existing assets Kaorfa could find. such as the music, (play TheFatRat - Unity on the tape across). ... (Stop music).

Susie: Right so, Do you have any idea? If Kaorfa got everything and he KNOWS everything, why can't still he get started? Could you find the answer, have you knew?

Zoblatos: To this day, Kaorfa and us still cannot find the answer. We still finding anything including suggesting Kaorfa to use Wacom Cintiq for if displays without touch screen, so he can sculpt right by his hand directly into the paper. But Kaorfa saw too many stuffs restricted & paywalled hence he already lost hope before he could use the suggestion.

Susie: Man, that sucks. We gotta help him again today!

Zoblatos: I'm sorry, it's not that easy. Kaorfa has already too depressed looking at the condition of 3D model collecting games. We can't do anything at all. All we can do now, is to deliver the message.

Susie: How do we do that?

Zoblatos: The message is far away, at the Trucker's Shrine. I need your help to deliver that scroll back outside and then upload it to the internet.

Susie: Because, there's bunch of monster?

Zoblatos: Exactly. We can't go ourselves. I know everything in this world, and you, ... you're gonna be the one to protect me while I upload it to the internet & seal the `Fountain`.

Ralsei: Fountain? uh that...

Zoblatos: Not that fountain. it's different. The fountain of Proprietarism, Expensivism, and Partialism. However, Kris, your ‚ù§Ô∏è soul, is compatible. idk how. Just.. idk.

<!-- continue pls -->

<!-- idea again:
- in introduction of Hotel room in Zoblaltos' house basement,
- tell room about
- warn to not get naked because Viorfa uploads this game to SFW enforced website & Odysee without PURPLE tag
 -->
