# Let's install the understand
Grevor Sritowi: (carry a tablet PC) Ahei, Star. I got something for you.

Star Butterfly: Oh sure! Go ahead!

Grevor: (open glimpse file) So this is a Glympse of Earth education which most beings understands. In this glympse, you'll see how *Homo sapiens* a.k.a. human, like me taught themselves by going to school everyday, everywhere, anytime. It also lets you have an idea a little bit about knowledge in it, notably popular knowledges, taught in a way human taught others since 1800s or so.

Star Butterfly: OH! I'm excited! can I have it?!

Grevor: Well, are you sure? this is not gonna be fun. Earth Education is the worst, lady..

Star: Oh.

Grevor: But don't be sad! this is the latest version which for many beings would feel easier to feel than previous version! Would you like to try?

Star: OKay!!

Grevor: (pat Star's head) okay, hang in there. (limbic install the understand of Earth Education)

## BZZZZZZZZZ!!!!

Grevor: Done!!!

Star: (brain feel heavy) ðŸ˜µ...

Grevor: Whoops. uh, I'm sorry. Well, it's hard to take easy Earth Education. It's suck you know, but, all alien protesters installs this, to better understand why

# Earth Education, shouldn't have existed.

Grevor: basically it.

Star: Oh, ... man... The grading, the math, the lack of talent nurturing stuffs..

Grevor: Yeah, that's right. You have been on the school on Earth, right? thinking whatever you'd like and humans don't easily accept that, forcing to... yea you know, that.. it.

Star: Wow. I have no idea before why F was a thing, now I know.. broader spectrum of Jargons here from Earth.

Grevor: Jargons? oh! Jargon. that's right, `Best Student` thingy

Star: exactly! wait. yeah!! ... yea... ðŸ˜¥

Grevor: Don't be sad. **It doesn't matter!** I have 2,5 GPA when I was graduating S1 and that burden, makes me lazy to continue to S2.

Star: S1, S2, S3 OH!!! Bachelor, Master, Doctor, like that!

Grevor: yes. And yeah, I just forget about it. Because luckily I now live in Dasandim and have job here in Dasandim.

Star: alright cool. um, do you have Finland / Crossban Standard Education?

Grevor: Perfect timing! I was just about to install this next education for you! (open Crossban standard education file) hang tight! (pat Star's head & install personally adapting Crossban education)
