# we done zetrux research

## Meta Runner Tari

This research costed us IDR 305000 you know, but it was worth it.

However, I really wonder if that was not it. I mean,

- How in the world did you get that flesh here, considering now she is originally an.. *AI*??
- Then she is a clone? No parent? Baby tube?
- Is there anything, more behind than this?

## Zetrix verse

So the surreal blender meme could be called Zetrix verse. And that's how it did become a problem.

A craze of NFT ruined this reputation for *verse*. Metaverse, whatever, all is associated as NFT.

Well done. How do we supposed to easily call our world? People, some, has difficulty of recalling brand. And *Surreal Blender Meme World* is rather complicated to say and perhaps remember.

## end word

Pls don't forget announce shut down our 7 keys sunreddit and use Odysee from now on.
