# NEWESTED ...
but unfortunately, Kade quit FNF modding. and uh. his [twitter](https://twitter.com/KadeDeveloper) has been suspended 😭. Warm and bad!

## BACK AT IT AGAIN AT `KRISPY KREME`
NEW! Kade new Twitter, **Found.** https://twitter.com/kade0912 yeya!!!

# Changes
- NEW!!! ARROW COLLAPSE just like [osu!](https://osu.ppy.sh). If you fail, **BLUE BALLED**, your arrows collapses. Not perfect, but there it is.
- SPLASH NOTE!!! We yoinked Psych Engine's splash note [code](https://github.com/ShadowMario/FNF-PsychEngine/blob/main/source/PlayState.hx ). But.. uh we lack the sprite. So for now we use Psych's remade one (because the code & SparrowAtlas XML was designed for it). we also yoinked luckydog7's yoink (maybe original?) of [splash note asset](https://github.com/luckydog7/Funkin-android/blob/master/assets/shared/images/noteSplashes.png ) just in case circularly.
- Cartoon dot! after you finished all notes, it'll appear for few second. Yep, just like classic cartoon film strip! and then transition to the end card. like that.
- Delayed Week Overbuse Kevin Macleod. sorry people, this song of `Heartbreaking` takes long to follow its tempo. it supposedly short song, for only about uh.. 100 seconds, or 100 beats? let's see again. yeah. that's unexpected, not to mention other bonuses too.
- have real blackbar yess! this real blackbar, while same as in stage, renders above stage and characters.
- BLUEBALL COUNTER. for final pecking time. Everytime you finish all notes, it'll reset the counter into 0. quit won't reset. every fail of course adds 1. you can see how many blueballs in pause menu.
- Whitty came back! here [definitive](https://gamebanana.com/mods/354884 ) psychedly & [original](https://gamebanana.com/mods/44214 ). We also have updated aesthetics around this mod to reflect that strike back. Idea, turn the LFM board panel logo into gold after also Saubo & Alfeheur came back as all as Whitty does.
- UNPAUSE PREPARATION! After you unpause, you'll get countdown, and after reach 0, it'll continue again. I swear I've asked this before on Stepmania GitHub repo issues, where the peck was it?!
- Force Quantization even when modchart loaded. Not recommended since this may mess up crazy note transformings if modchart has it.
- There is still no JUCEFlixel yet
- Return back the Accident Volume Key destroyer. You can now adjust toggle in the option menu, audio section yey!
- Add dropdown for Event changee & list in Chart JSON editor, with HaxeUI due to how flawed FlxUI is right now. e.g. no blocking when dropdown opened and clicking it may click whatever beneath the cursor position.
- TJSONify all JSON loading systems
- fixed Happy Birthday to you. The toast pops when somebody hbd upon press enter in title screen
- install gif loading system. thancc GWebDev [yey](https://github.com/Perkedel/Kaded-fnf-mods/commit/1bf665606349b778a2ec63163d76cf7d1e6a2476 )
- add ask parent / guardian first before visit the URL in Pls Update screen, just like classic kid oriented TV ads
- fix some mistake
- Psyched score zoom wow!
- Moved the judgment to the right because it makes sense. sorry if that blocks you but the viewer will be confused who's judgement is this for.
- add vibration feedback on some big menu buttons, especially all in main menu
- rebroad the donate button links, [expanded](https://github.com/Perkedel/Kaded-fnf-mods/commit/723672ba1fdf22baf37878681b29dd0d4dc615f0 )! Now, not just the original vanilla FNF you can visit, but also me and friends related FNF links yey!
- shader faile
- reported all missing stuff to Admiral Zumi & Torik Pextroriol
- I should've try FlxUI or HaxeUI back buttons especially in option menu
- shrink credit rollout size a bit. also make it acknowledge pause and unpause
- Remember, I am talking about [games](https://github.com/Perkedel/Kaded-fnf-mods/commit/420b3d54a30426affd0194bad6a843c684337874 ), not tools. Don't pay for tools.
- Roig Hermalansa now [reunite](https://github.com/Perkedel/Kaded-fnf-mods/commit/420b3d54a30426affd0194bad6a843c684337874#commitcomment-63650738 ) with Admiral Zumi at his X0p1r4t3 palace next update
- fixed some Chart Event executions. these shall only appears in certain beat!
- pls [mah](https://github.com/Perkedel/Kaded-fnf-mods/commit/6cd3ab3ecf707d08b2a6028fa41f2725f110ea7c ) ye
- [Did not delete & takedown TheFatRat songs](https://github.com/Perkedel/Kaded-fnf-mods/commit/454dba16ebcba9595c3ea6176e8616c10ace4c7f ) and the chart JSON song using it just because he went [RCRDSHP NFT](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmpP7e9gLYs ). His music are still royalty free. still, right click, save as!
- SPLASH SCREEN!!! Now we have splash screen in style of Android smartphone / table boot screen wow!
- add force extend to 4'33" because you decided to end song early
- ADD DON'T END SONG EARLY! You can leave this option, so you will wait only until the Music finishes playing rather than immediately which is always unpleasant experience many of the time.
- `Std.isOfType()` ➡️ `Std.is()`
- Hex loading screen faile, return back to classic but keep the combinationer. you can use loading screen if the next state loads song.
- Freeplay thread might be faile and unstable. enabling this option will load freeplay in other thread rather than freezing the entire game. it's unstable though, and can crash.
- Oh God, idk anymore. Pls come back! also declare the app logo as a family crest Umnaga x Saubo yey.
- SKIP Dialog!!! you can now click skip dialog with touch screen
- AUTO DIALOG!!! You can enable auto dialog which timer can be set when to press. these options can be adjusted on demand right during dialog. of course, option menus too exists. Maybe I should add Pushing P for something 😏😏😏😏😏😏 yeah. Complicated! that requires complex Live2D. maybe later.
- Tankman Intro & Outro!! WOw video cutscener after state cutscener?!??! no way!!! Yep, We have yoinked luckydog7's yoink of week7 intro! now you can have low latency video play & finish! this is another different than state video cutscener. now it goes like: state video, tankman intro, in game flashmob, dialogue intro, gameplay, dialogue outro, in game flashmob outro, tankman outro, state video outro. yeah! and then go back the loop but for different song.
- idk how to yoink Psyched blammed light help! I had it here, but idk how to used at the moment.
- all UI must must use FlxUI instead! so e.g. `FlxButton` becomes `FlxUIButton`. these extension of UI are much better, I suppose.
- Of couse, sometimes still not work well that's why we have [HaxeUI](http://haxeui.org/ )
- Add [Office button](https://www.javatpoint.com/microsoft-office-button ) (`FILE`) & Shift hold button in Charting JSON editor! Because there is touchscreener. the office menu uses same pause menu, we made special mode for it.
- also Nav pad as well in bottom tab of forgot. it's on first tab! Chart editor JSON
- CAM SHAKE MODCHART zo not forgor. Test the example at Sub Urban - Cradles (Week TOXIC, song 2)
- wishlisted [Average4K](https://store.steampowered.com/1828580/Average4k )

- reyoinked character info from master branch of Kade Engine. I should also have to merge last of the last master branch after this.
- Polymod broke! downgrade it to v1.3.1! Oh noo!!! Hey, GitHub Desktop. open local repository straight to that gitted Haxelib! `C:\HaxeToolkit\haxe\lib\polymod\git` that's right! then checkout to commit, anything right with tag of `v1.3.1`, then branch it out!

### Somewhere in a wooden minimal house. Help what year this supposed to be.... uh.. 2002, I guess.
Molin Johansen (dad, *Homo sapiens*): (press record) Okay, recording.. So, around my room.. is clear, yes, ... let's.. (attach the handycam to the tripod), (push yaw lever foward to face the camera down to this table and Yolaine), Okay. (rush towards the chair to sit next to Yolaine). Now..

Yolaine (mom, demon): *I, Yolaine, with my husband, Molin. Here my sacrifice to my only daughter ... ...*

Molin: (small voice) it's okay..

Yolaine: .. *for you, my lord.* (Take kitchen knife), (slash necc of "*baby*")! (take of head), (devour)... mmmm! "yummy".. (share to Molin)

Molin: (devour).. Yeah, "very delicious"!

(finish the devour)
## BEGIN
### Intergalactic Census Database Center Dasandim branch, Dasandim. 2022
Jonah Kuerveq: Hey, why do we still have to f888888 do this s8888? You should already know, that film breaks my heart! maybe yours too. So it's all terrible.

Henry Kuerveq: Okay, listen. If you said that because they made **him** become forgotten absolutely good, I agree with you. Now what do you say? what reason?

Jonah: .. Same as you.

Henry: Great. But uh.. there's still more to take a look at, bro. Kaorfa insists that we await for those all.

Jonah: This doesn't getting end is it? That cinematic universe all have been tarnished longer they ran. Probably after the demise of the original owner. Sorry being rude, but I believe that's it could be to be honest.

Henry: Well, hope for the best.

Queue computer: (announce) Number A063, to counter Central 1.

Fotter Tyulvon: Kuerveq family! 

Henry: Alright, let's go. (go towards counter Central 1)

Jonah: 😑(also go to counter Cental 1)..

Fotter: Alright, here.. (put certificate to the counter), your certificate of contribution for your overseer project towards `Marvel` cinematic Universe. Wow. I'm sorry to what happen right now.

Henry: Me too. But it's okay. I'm not sure what look after this.

Fotter: Just to know that, as promised he has been returned and it's done. Been so much couple trouble bigga higga for that big guy being Selfish vs here idk how to say it. They looks like want to fanart with something there to fill the universe and it just.. conflicting for these two.

Henry: Yeah man. Very heavy.

Jonah: So, can I conclude that's the risk possible for making "*fanart*" out of someone's owned character?

Fotter: Yes. it can be like that. I advise to tell everyone and perhaps other parties, should they are fiddling with something that doesn't made by their universe, not to mention the.. **radioactive** ones, to cease and d.. wait. Stop, just stop, talking about this. The consequences is great, and may lead to great destruction, just like what happen to that hero guy.

Jonah: Okay. Thancc for your advice, I'll take a look at it and immediately tell those who do.

Fotter: Please do so, I am afraid that Kaorfa too were doing the similar these days. better take a look that that first.

Jonah: We'll do. Rest assured, we going to have it.

Henry: Okay, one more thing. Do you have anybody that need help overseering today?

Fotter: (exploring overseer help wanted).. ummm so far... there wasn't any huge overseer needed big help right now. Weird. Hmm, must be because Kaorfa was focusing on one thing in here. So, that's your opportunity, take a look at Wakturia.

Henry: Okeh! thancc. Great luck & God Bless you.

Fotter: You too.

Jonah: Same.

Henry: C'mon, bro!

(new arrive)

Abunaga Rund Dalim (tall, darktoner, round chubb forme): Welcome to Intergalactic Census Database center, gentlemen, how can I help you? Query? ...

Gyouter Embinosa: Query for somebody pls.

Abunaga: Alright, sir, (press `Query` button), (give queue ticket) here your number, please wait in the waiting space, thank you 🙏.

(sitt in the waiting chair)

Queue Computer: Number B0001, to counter Central 1.

(go to the counter of center)

Fotter: Alright, Gyouter.. wait oh hey! what's up?

Gyouter: Excuse me, you do know this somebody (emit telepathy beam information of `   ` towards Fotter) like this?

Fotter: (received) oh okay, hold on a sec.. (search that somebody)... Found it. and uh... she's already died about couple decades ago. 

Toseliem Morek (Co-founder of Io's appartment, same appartment Gyouter visited couple months ago): 🤨?!?! (async) (haste to queue ticket machine), (press `Queue` button), (take ticket)!!, (stand behind Gyouter & Latsufir on that counter)!.

Fotter: Apparently some family issues from what I've heard of, and uh, you might be disgusted when I say this, idk if this is true, but.. her parents ate her like a cake when she was still a baby. Idk, **it wasn't just a random sacrifice, man!.**, The parents are members of a club, but uh... a coup de tat happens, the original leader was murdered, and this so called *demon killer* uh, wants everyone to eat their child, if they are demon. if not, then they'll be forgiven. It seems like uh... idk. that demon killer of course hates demon, but uh somehow I... my heart, feels bad, even though they're demon.

Gyouter: Alright, thank you for your information. Huh, weird.

Fotter: Okey are we done here?

Gyouter: I guess, we'll then find out another way. that's sus. (about to leave)

Toseliem: (go into the counter) You two, wait!

Gyouter: huh?

Latsufir Umnaga: ok?

Fotter: Wait, lemme just uh (press `next queue`).

Queue Computer: Number B0002, to counter Central 1.

Toseliem: Hey, what did you just say about `   `?!

Fotter: Wait, uh who.. oh, Toseliem?

Toseliem: Yeah, say that again.

Fotter: Look sir (search again same), I just say anything within this database, (found again) and still she dedd couple decades ago.

Toseliem: That is wrong, utterly wrong!

Fotter: Huh? Okay, buddy, (remembered that Io appartment is notorious for keeping secret) if you keep not telling us about it then this uh.. *misinformation* still going to be!

Toseliem: Okay, right. We are sorry. ... idk.

Fotter: It's okay, you just..

Toseliem: I took take of her all this time. From the beginning, I am the one that rescued her. the baby there, was a **cake**. copy of her. over realistically made for that video. Indeed, a coup de tat, that *demon killer* wants all baby demon dead, so swapped her so her parent won't be murdered because not murdering their baby if it is demon.

Fotter: Oh, I did not know that. Okay we should prepare you discussion room for this, shall we?

Toseliem: Definitely. Gyouter, Latsufir, come with me.

Gyouter: Alright, uh, Excuse but...

Toseliem: OH sorry, I haven't introduced myself. My name is Toseliem Morek. And I am co-founder of Io's appartment. As you can see, Io is my childhood best friend. Also, I helped `   ` and her parents take care. We fostered them during time like this. Sorry for now showing up, I've been very busy recently. lots of job that needs me there.

Gyouter: Wait, Why I did not see you? We were there couple months ago and uh.. okay, I'm sorry (I took her entire appartment cell to Wakturia because we thought she died).

Toseliem: That's alright, she should be safe with you... uh (remembered recently she did not home since april 2021, whatever month that thing trashed is) 😢...

Gyouter: Don't worry, I saw her, she came back finally.

Toseliem: Oh really?

Fotter: Gentlemen, your meeting room 1.

### Meeting Room 1
(sitt).

Toseliem: Alright, the story is little long.

Gyouter: Alright, *play the movie* (telepathically tell) for us, we'll help you.

Toseliem: So, it begins at the ...

### Flashback
> A Friendship club.

#### Rondel Friendship club, center hall
(enjoy dinner)

> Was just a usual dinner party, we uh.. eat delicious burgers, pizza, and stuff.

Obul Lugrim Henson: (stab Rondel's chest from behind with his laser watch gun)!!!

Rondel Uredith Mivim: **HOAAAA!!!** (melted).

> Until there was somebody.

(everyone panik)

Obul: People of human! your day finally come, that you'll be saved from devious & deceitful ones!

> He called himself:

Obul: I, am, 

> Demon Killer

(everyone disgusted)

Obul: Hey! where's the introduction people? Do you want yourselve be devoured by demon's deceits???! You can be dragged to hell! Don't marry demons! God hates demon!!!

> Like.. idk, To be honest, this sounds like a toxic people would say on social media. Bewildering.
> But that's not all. Obul really, really hates demon. so hateful, he want them all dead.

Obul: Fine. Your satan leader is dead! Now I am in charge. But look at this. demons still everywhere in this very room. Lookout! Because one by one, You demons gonna be dead! **GO BACK TO HELL!!**

> Now this.. memorably, tragic request here

Obul: First, the babies. That's right, if you can kill the babies, we stopped them before they got too strong. Eat them all. I wanna see the video, must be real, genuine like Windows!, or else, your demon wife or husband *I'll take care*. YOU GOT 1 WEEK FROM THIS SECOND!!!

(everyone devastated)

Obul: **DISMISS!!!**, you demon f888kers. How degenerate you've been now. Don't escape, and I got your phone numbers and your `social security number` because I already work for government (a secret organisation somewhere from Earth). We know where you are. and always knew.

#### Io's office
Toseliem: Oh man. Like the hell how do we gonna save them from this! Obul already knew and will always knew man. Ugh! Io, you got something?

Io Latahan: Okay, this is not complete. But my idea is, the only solution is, to uh, swap the baby with somekind of dummy. BUT...

Toseliem: Obul's gonna find out already. unless... you remember the cake shop we've met earlier?

Io: Which one? Leaveland?

Toseliem: Exactly! that realistic cake builder! ... do you have Kivrontz?

Io: Okay, for babies like her, I think it costs us around 3200 Kvz. Well, not that much I guess. (camera view Toseliem) This is for her, and her family. You wouldn't want that adorable little baby die useless in a hands of **Toxic Christian Extremist** do ya?

Toseliem: Of course not! That's we're going to do. Consult first however.

#### Leaveland Bakery
> Then we consulted with Leaveland, tell everything, and stuff like that.

Josh Leaveland: Okay. Right, I see. This cake right here should be ready in about 3 days. and this cost you... take it.

Toseliem: Wait, what?

Josh: No joke. Obul killed my parents because they're demon. Well, resurrected already and now live in Dasandim. Still! That Obul must go! He will kill innocent demons more! Not welcome.

Io: 😯 (Whoahow, no way!!!)

Toseliem: Okay. thank you.

Josh: You're welcome. Stay safe, and everyone.

> Honestly I would be excited given it free of charge, but I can't. Obul is already a bad guy instead of a good guy, no matter what claim that he works for God. idk, just killing innocent people would be so ironic when we told not to according to the commandments, I guess.

### Molin's house
> Another thing we did to keep the baby safe is to unfortunately, make Obul think she's indeed dead, eaten. The most effective way is that to separate her from her parents, making scene that she no longer exists spatially but already "in stomach and becomes poop" like that.

Molin: (looking outside through door window)... (saw Toseliem & Io)! They're coming!

Yolaine: Who's that?

Molin: Friend, friend. don't worry.

Toseliem: (knock door)!

Molin: (open door) Alright, get in! (pull Toseliem in) (close door)

Toseliem: Okay, the cake's gonna come up in second. You prepared the recording sequence?

Molin: (see Yolaine sitt on chair at other side of table ahead of camera tripoded) Yes here ah.

Toseliem: Good now.

Molin: 😢...

Toseliem: Hey hey, it's okay (hug). We'll take care your baby. Where's the baby?

Molin: On her!

Toseliem: Okeh. Yolaine?

Yolaine: (stand up & assemble together)!

Toseliem: Alright. This, unfortunately gonna be the last. c'mon, (hug together).. ... ... ... (finish hug) Alright,

Yolaine: (hand the baby but still hold hand)..

Toseliem: (softly grab baby). Don't worry, baby. We will take care of you. You can still connect through with our technologies.

Melabim Progon: (knock door)!!, Leaveland bakery?

Toseliem: (hand off baby back to Yolaine), hold on. (go to door), (open door), (quickly but carefully take the cake box)! Okeh thancc, Now GO!!

Melabim: Yes, sir! (quickly ran away)

Toseliem: Alright, we should prepare the thing now. We must be quick.

### fake dummy baby prepared
Toseliem: Alright, looks real. (lift the cake set and find the ON/OFF switch), (turn ON the actuation simulation)!, (release cake set). Alright, it's ON. (inspect the realistic plastic kitchen knife included)... Huh, this is too obvious. Kitchen knife pls.

Molin: (take a kitchen knife) here knife?

Toseliem: Right, (put the knife next to cake set). So, I think this is good. I intentionally make it imperfect preparation to make it not obvious, like... you are devastated and messy having to *sacrifice* your baby stuff like that. Okay, this starts getting confusing, we gotta take the real baby. Yolaine?

Yolaine: 😢..

Molin: Hey, it's okay honey.

Toseliem: Oh man. Best friend will take care best friends & families. Man..

Yolaine: (*surrender* the baby to Molin)..

Molin: (give to Toseliem) 😢..

Io: (shout from outside) Bro! you done??

Toseliem: Hang in there! one more sec! Okay. Ugh.... Great luck, God Bless you. May us be met again. ... (open door), (step out), (seek again one last time)....., (close door slowly). (sad face & head down) ☹️ ..

Io: Dude, c'mon!

Toseliem: Yeah, I.. (bit running back to van).. (entered fan with the baby), (close right van slide door, van will go right of where from house)

Io: How's the baby?

Toseliem: Here, got it in my hand.

Io: (ponder, ah so cute)...

Toseliem: GO!!!

Io: OH!!! Sorry!, (hit gas pedal)!...

> And we go home. with the baby. Swear in our oath to take care of her well, until she can take care of herself. and probably even she can, we must protect her.

### Gate of rocket launch station, Sombil Rocket launch pad
Io: (stopping car for security guard)... (stopped).

Danny Nomar: (get out from post), (start interview) welcome to Sombil launch pad. can I help you?

Io: (scroll down right driver window)...

Danny: Io?

Io: Sssh!

Danny: (whisper) okey, what's going on?

Io: (head swing little bit to back)!, !.

Danny: 👍-👍!, (press `open` on remote)!

Io: ... (gate open, now go inside)..

Danny: (close gate) Great luck, God Bless you.

### Rocket flew
(scene of rocket launching)

(scene of inside passenger spaceship)

(scene of arriving into Io's appartment)

### Day in life
> Well, Although we just stand there, afar from home, but our technologies, the remote control robots makes the interaction real 1 to 1.

(these 2 robots connects to parents from original house)

Molin: (equip remote control suit)

Yolaine: (also equip remote control suit)

Molin: (connect all to robot)

(connected)

Yolaine: baby!!

`  `: (happy baby noise)

Molin: (coochi lullaby)... (notices people are watching her)? (look to appartment cell entry door window)!

(Everyone ran away)!!

Keith Olamson (not bf despite that blue cyan hair): (still looking)

Halone Olamson (mom): Keith? C'mon! (grab Keith's hand)

Keith: Aww mom!

> Well, I can say that she's the cutest baby in this appartment. So precious. Must protecc!
> And all that goes on. She learns from her parent, she love to teach herself new things, and stuffs along the way..

(scene B roll of `   ` doing something technological)

> Everything is happy, like usual, when nothing happened.
> Until..

`   `: Mom? Dad? hello?? (attempt to reconnect)... No Internet connection?

### Internet died. (note: 2015)
(verbal riot of scientists (residents) because internet died)

Toseliem: (bang open door of Io's office)!!! IO! IO!!! this is bad!

Io: (also unable to connect to internet) Yeah yeah! I know.

Toseliem: WiFi's dead!

Io: No, actually just the internet, but yea. Ah man! Have you tried to contact support?

Toseliem: We have!!! but the customer service is busy.

Io: DAMN IT!

### Hijack of Cellular
Vlick (CEO of VlickCell, is demon too): Alright, those all blocked. no access.

Obul: I think you lacked 1, what is this? `LBRY`? That new thing? Hey, remember, Crypto is work of a satan, you wake up man! those chippers won't asleep now!

Vlick: Dude, that's not necessarily true. We need videos to share knowledge, I know there's bad, but remember the good also.

Obul: Do you watch video or read bible???!!!

Vlick: 😠?! Look, You've been murdering lots of demon. I know, God up there is fighting against them. But I believe, killing innocent demon that doesn't any related to Lucifer is just not a different than murdering innocent human. I swear to God, human would say so, pretty sure!

Obul: block, OR E..

Vlick: OKEY fINE! (block `LBRY` access) here. no more LBRY.

Obul: Good. (leave).... (nvm), (shoot laser upon Vlick's head behind)!! (continue leave). Alright, change my mind. block all internet, disgusting satan. *bible haters!*

### back again
Quilmor (the tentacle guy): (failed to contact customer service even with all 8 different phones he had) No hope.

Toseliem: Damn it, I should go to to Vlick myself.

Iboh: (grab Toseliem's hand) Wait! Don't. (send telepathy) I sense war.

Toseliem: (received)... No. no no no.

Io: 😢

Toseliem: `   `? (immediately go to `   ` appartment cell)..

### lost connection. `   ` appartment cell
Toseliem: (traversing through chaos & riots amongst scientists) Whoah! haa!!! Easy, gentlepeople! Ouf!!! (arrived).. `   `? (straight into the cell) Hey, `   `? you okay?

`   `: 😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😭

Toseliem: Come here baby, (hug `   `) uncle's here. sssh sssh sssh sssh sssssh... It's okay. We'll make it fine. Can make it fine.

> Obul has is getting more insane, more than he had already been. He forces everyone on that planet to `worship God` so constantly, and demons, must die, unlive.

(scene of family with demons locking down themselves)

> With this, no demons ever came out since. they'll be murdered on sight if spotted. Only humans that are treated like luxury and VIP. Demons? yeah you know already.

### Party? no demon!

Puhjo: Ahem, check family. (start scanning family)

Cole Grahams: Okey.

Puhjo: One is demon! (shoot wife with laser)

Oleri: (scream & dying)!!!!

Cole: NOOOOOO!!!! YOU MONSTER!!!

Puhjo: Enjoy your night. Yes? Check family. (scan other family)... Nope! your husband is demon.

Janice Bickerson: F8888 hell!

> Think you can pass that party with any of your family of demon? Unfortunately you wish.

### Traverse through dimension
> Now, `   ` likes to travel through dimensions. She has been learning the art of teleportation recently.
> latest discovery is that she wanted to meet what world thought it was just a fictional blue haired guy, no, no that Keith we had, somebody else instead.

(scene of `   ` simp of bf)

> Like, yeah, I know when to get skeptical, but of course. Being scientist, no scepticism shall stop you from doing your thesis. no I mean, fun projects. It is, uh statements, only valid when you tried and have the result.

(scene of `   ` attempting to contact bf & made appointment), **(appointment approved)**

> And so it begins.

(scene of `   ` finally successfully entered to the white dimension)

> I hope for her success, but after that, that was last time I saw her.

(scene of floral tributing in front of `   `'s appartment cell)

> Yeah, we wept. Can't stand such a cute girl went just like that. I know, we have alot of scientist just got killed on their experiment.

### Attempt to rescue `   `. (I think it was may that mod got trashed) Io in his office call Dasandimian Resurrection division
Io: Yeah? hello? okeh, we got another scientist died here. She lost in her experiment dimension.

Kilo Rakabuyes (yes, Zeni Rakabuyes's father. His wife is Ginger Rakabuyes): Location as usual? what room?

Io: Thirty Seventy, Thirtieth floor! (3070, 30th floor)

Kilo: Uh oh.. Okay, calm down. we'll be right there

Io: keep in mind, it's locked! very secure.

Kilo: (while also preparing himself, stood up & preparing) Don't worry, We can push her inside.

### Resurrector arrived
Kilo: Excuse us, everyone! (immediately scan area with handheld scan gun).... People?

(prepared the Resurrector portable)

Minhey Rundley: Ready, sir!

Kilo: Alright, (start resurrection scan, track, and take).

(15 second later, 404 Not found)

Kilo: Whoah, cannot find it?

Toseliem: Serious? no, that should be able

Kilo: Yeah I know, interdimensional. (start attempt resurrection again, but increase overall wattage).

Io: Be careful, sir. My power capacity is only up to 16 Million Gigawatts!

Kilo: Yeah, I know. Pls, `   `, don't leave us 😰!!... Ohhh God...

(still 404 not found)

Minhey: Uh sir, neither in Heaven or Hell can she be found, sir. This machine also already same explored all dimension for 200s of them around us of our current dimension. Weird. I think at 201st..

Dyulaba Muginson: (suddenly rush towards the crowd) GUYS!!!! LOOK WHAT I FOUND!!!

Io: What's going on?

Dyulaba: (arrived to Io and crowds) 😆 You can't believe what's happening here! I just... I just, finally!!! for f8888 finally! I caught 🎥 it!!! (play video) **in 4K UHD!!!!**

Io: Okay, this might be awkward for today's context, what dimension is that?

Dyulaba: Uh, it looks like... Oh I know, people call this `White Border`! 

(everyone gasp) 😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱 oh my God!

Dyulaba: Pretty cool huh? so bright, blindingly bright, wow. this is not for the OLED screen. ... wait. uh, di I Just. (look at Kilo's face)... Oh, sorry. Somebody inside?

Io: 😢...

Dyulaba: Oh noh... I shouldn't have. Uh, I'll send you the video okay? (press `share`), (select Io's phone). There. You should see it. ... See you later guys. 😢

### Post Trash
> Ever since that, Io's getting crazy. scrounging every place he could find to get her back alive. Despite everything, and with the thing he thought the key to bring her back. it's just a [photo](https://www.reddit.com/r/DedWebsites/comments/qhijdb/findable_in_archiveorg_wayback_machine_though_3/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3 ). even if you had it, it feels different, unlike if this is not happening at all.

(scene of Io in mad scientist mode)

> One day, Io pops an idea. He wanted to break open her appartment cell. There is no choice. the previous choice gone. Time to break the museum open. But.. it's locked, very secure.
> That's why, Io visited you. You people are known to have skill of lockpicking.
> and the rest, is your history.

## back to out Meeting Room 1
Toseliem: Now, you said you saw `   ` is back. For real?

Grevor: Uh yeah, hold on, lemme get the (search call log from Yume)... right, (play in front of Toseliem)

Toseliem: 😢...

Grevor: Well, So.. she's back. I think that belongs to you. So

Toseliem: NO., no need. Keep it.

Latsufir: 😳???

Grevor: Uuuuh, pardon?

Grevor: Hey, it's okay. I already know what's going on these days. Saorfa has told us that situations around her is no longer safe. But... You don't want to cast her out just because of all this, do you?

Toseliem: 😭 I know, I hate it. But we lost the only choice! Pls, if you are the only help and hope we could have here.

Grevor: Of course.

Toseliem: ... I need to tell you something, can't stress this enough from what you already know currently.

## Flashback again
(Scene of protests of `   ` goned)

> Ever since the incident, entire scientist in our apartment held protest to the world. all residents volunteered in this scrounging together to find the only precious girl we had.
> People sharing posters, leaflets, everything, all around the world, in a hope to find her whereabout.

(Scene of Find `   ` initiative jobs)

> Of course, somebody big, I believe, who owns part of the timeline Kaorfa forked yoinked to here, did...
> I cannot describe this. it's going to be an insult. I mean, that somebody, if they want it gone, then they insists.

(Scene of violently cancel demonstration with rubber tube gun, water cannon, and other law enforcement demo breaker stuffs)

> Somebody just tell his other somebody.
> Many of the time, it went to far.

(Scene of one of the somebody going to shoot that demonstrator because often reuploading again and again)

Normspeak: ✋✋ (hands up in the air) Please! You don't have to do this. You guys works for people. you already know that. I know you want it gone, but I insist you and your friend to talk about this, No Trash will resolve this!

*somebody idk*: Grow up kid. (fire ban gun)💥!!!

### Fallen back into Ice Cream Area
Slospeak: You should go home, brother. Find safe place. I will be here for a while.

Normspeak: (contemplating this disappointing people of Monkes)😠😠.... (pause contemplate) Right, what did you say?

Slospeak: ☹️...

Normspeak: Alright, we still have appointment here. (checking schedule)... On [Lectrife](https://gamejolt.com/games/last-funkin-moments/634559 ). Wait. Why Lectrife? They took down one of the stuff for political reason. Huuhhh. I hope we can find any better place than any of these 3 or whatever. Something that is not even controlled by anyone, but who uploaded it. I know, can't be fully possible, but at least no political correctness stand for this one here.

Slospeak: 😑...

Normspeak: Alright, bro. I need to go. Great luck, God Bless you.

Slospeak: God bless you too.

## Back to meeting room again
Grevor: Alright, I will remember and contemplate this warning. We make sure that we careful, and stay covert.

Toseliem: Amazing. Right, so.. before we go to the original `   ` family house, we need a weapon.

Grevor: Okay. what specs do we need specifically?

Toseliem: In case Obul comes up, we could defend ourselves from his notoriusly bio-melting laser watch.

Grevor: Alright... we get it from... Okay, we have no idea how to defeat Obul & shield from it.

Toseliem: That's why, we gotta... Horme! (call Horme) ... ...

Horme: (Pick up) Yeah hello?

Toseliem: Hey, sup! Toseliem.

Horme: Oh hey, OH sorry, I will to have party this night.

Toseliem: NO no no, it's just your strongest weapon that could defeat demon killer like Obul.

Horme: oh. okay. Are you sure? he's smart though. You can't dodge his laser.

Toseliem: Well, me and 2 others, and possible 2 more. yep, so uh (small volume) me 1, 2 oh 3 plus ... 2 ... Five. 5, we need 5.

Horme: Hah, why would I intentionally forget? lol! Okay. don't forget, 6 PM, usual, Borsta Ballroom.

Toseliem: Alrighty then.

Horme: Oh yeah! it costs you 500000 Kvz in total. This strongest weapon here definitely helps you beat and defend from Obul.

Toseliem: Okay, Five hundred kay Kivrontz, got it.

Horme: see ya! (close call)

Toseliem: Alright, we got him.

Horme: (lean towards)🤨??

Turniq: (release `shut the f888 up` magic)!!

Colnie: HHH HAAh! 💢 ARGH! What the hell bro?

Horme: Hey! it's okay. .. (spawn soundproof magic barrier sphere encapsulating Horme, Turniq, & Colnie) (hand up & close fist)! You can keep it to me. No cancel culture, guaranteed 😁!

Bonung: Yes, sir. (enable alertful mode on modern monocle)!

## Backyard of the ballroom
Horme: Alright so, we got prepped up. I guess you want it quick? yeah I am also as impatient as you are. So, (show Kvz payment QR code) if you wanna go ahead then do it.

Toseliem: (pickup Obul-buster riffle), (inspect the riffle)..

Horme: Oh wait, so soon hah! I'm afraid it's dud and no backup this time. After all it's still beta. Obul is getting stronger everytime you know

Toseliem: (aim at that fat dummy target shapped like Obul himself prepped just for this transaction)... (fire)!!!

(dummy vapourized)

Toseliem: Whoah! Vapourizer? Is that too far..

Horme: Forget that man. Obul is already too notorious from being rescued. his brain finally as hard as iron. dedicated his life entirely to it. Oh also it has (press `shield` button on front vertical grip) shield too. It even doesn't get dud when you shoot.

Toseliem: Impressive!

Horme: Yeah, but not perfect. long way to go.

Toseliem: Alright, I don't have much time for this. How much again?

Horme: 500000 Kvz! Oh wait, I remember something.

Toseliem: what is it?

Horme: The creator of this weapon has background. He made this weapon because his son was murdered, because the kid is demon. So, take it. He wants you to take Obul down, and you will do it.

Toseliem: Thancc, but no, I just gonna (prepare 500000 kvz e-payment)..

Horme: No no no! Not even me, Obul killed my parents too!

Toseliem: Okay, but (send 500000 kvz)

Horme: That's alright! (received 500000 Kvz) huh? ... Well, son and my parents have been resurrected. But yeah, Obul's gonna do it again.

Toseliem: Stay covert. I do this to not let Obul know. Blend it in.

Horme: 😢 Thancc. Well, isn't the weapon itself already blows your cover?

Grevor: Well, you are smart at disguissing transaction remember?

Horme: Oh yeah that's right! but

Grevor: (de-engrave the brand name `Obul-Buster` into `Superpower` to all 5 riffles)....

Horme: Okay. Right. SO, Great luck, and God bless you.

Latsufir: 😐

Molin: Toseliem, who's those two behind?

Toseliem: Friend! I got new friends!

Molin: Demon killer?!

Toseliem: No. 😐, they're from Dasandim.

Molin: ... ... Long time no see. (unlock front door & open)!

Toseliem: Go go go! (hand gesture get in fast now)

Gyouter: (got in)

Latsufir: (got in too)

Molin: (close & lock door), (take Benelli M4 with cool collapsible stock), (go upstair to ground floor), (right hand push emergency load from the slot into the bolt while at the same time charging it), (press little bolt release), (press magazine hold load release little button on the right, not to be confused with bolt release), (unlock safety), (aim towards Gyouter)

(all hands up in the air)

Toseliem: Hi, long time no see too. You remember, wow. Uh (look to Gyouter & Latsufir), these are not demon killers. they're here to help.

Molin: (aim to Latsufir)

Latsufir: 😨??!!

Molin: (threat closer)..

Toseliem: by the way, how did you get that M4 there? that's an Earth's weapon.

Molin: (put the deadly nozzle towards Latsufir nose)

Latsufir: 💓💓💓💓💓💓💓💓!!!!!!!!

Molin: (threat assesment successful, not a demon killer).. (draw down the shotgun), A human killer that came I defeated drops this (lift M4 a bit to point this shotgun). also this (show a name plate liontin).

Latsufir: 🫁(attempt to rerelax pounded heart 🫀💓💓💓 with breathing relaxer technique & right hand hold to chest) hooo haah hooo..

Gyouter: (support his shoulder for relaxing Latsufir panik heartbeat)

Toseliem: (run towards and examine the plate)... That's Earth people. Well, nice souvenir. very rare!

Molin: Thanks. You came so sudden. I have no idea what to ask. I have been hopeless.

Toseliem: You're welcome. Hey, How have you been? I know it's rough. but how rough?

Molin: ... You sure these 2 won't go hit us?

Toseliem: Oh c'mon brother. If they're one, they would've done it right ahead. or look at them.. See any excitement for them to kill?

Molin: (menacingly analyze Gyouter & Latsufir's body & face expressions scrollingly).... (leaked facial expression that seems like intent to kill Yolain not found) (Sigh)!... C'mon.

Gyouter: (follow Molin to basement)..

Latsufir: (also follow)

Molin: HEY!!.. No, killing. (✌️ to the eyes), (✌️ to forward)!?.. (resume going down stair)..

## Basement
Toseliem: Wow uh. nice basement.

Molin: I know you don't like it. Stop pretending.

Toseliem: Okay yea I'll be honest here. Man, Let me remember, it's been..

Molin: Decades, about 2. I already lost count.

Toseliem: ... (See Yolaine inside glass wooden cupboard) Oh, Yolaine? How you been? In glass board.. so tight..

Molin: The glass prevents infrared & X-ray detections. And the wood blocks cellular signal and also X-ray. Given from clubmate Joshua Norim.

Toseliem: Wow.

Gyouter: 😬... Okay, got a question, may I? ... Ever you taken her out regularly?

Molin: Of course I do. I am afraid demon can have atrophy just like human being. I cannot trust any trusted source, considering even demon can be slain like previously. (point to behind stair where one track of footprints)

(everyone look where it was pointed) (camera set position to view far behind stair towards the talk scene & see that Yolaine's Molin's footprint)

Gyouter: ... (look back again), okay. well you never go outside?

(all of the cameras battery combusts into flame) (video cut)

### end of video
Molin: Insola Obirin can only rescue camera & send it to all of us. The footage before & after lost. the hard disk got blown to dust, except all of the cameras which luckily still had the all SD cards survives somehow. That's where all the footages taken from, acts like a cache in case the [big purples](https://www.westerndigital.com/products/internal-drives/wd-purple-sata-hdd#WD10PURZ ) got hit like this one. Wow. [Purple SD card I say is a beast](https://www.westerndigital.com/products/memory-cards/wd-purple-microsd#WDD032G1P0C ). and uh.. 😢...

(Note, the big purples are in the basement where Depmin bombed it)

Toseliem: (pat shoulder & hug)..

Molin: (hiks)!!!, (hiks).. My best friends 😭😭😭😭... Oh God.. How many more you want them gone? 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭

Toseliem: No no, brother. It's not God. it's Henson. God no longer works for Henson. sshhhh ssh ssh ssh... C'mon, brother.

Gyouter: Hey, you have uh Teleporter around you?

Latsufir: Hold on, let me (take out portable deployable telporter pocket) Right, it's still prototype. See if it work (drop on the floor)!

Latsufier: Oh look, it works. I hope long. let me test (take out disposable telescopic aluminum rod), (extend rod), (put into inside portal frame)... Okay. SO, I got home for you. And.. you can move now.

Molin: Are you sure this safe?

Latsufir: 99%, still enough, but uh.. (look through portal) (speak as in for distance) I gotta turn this off for now, the battery lasts only for 6 hours! Hang in there, trust us!

Molin: You promise me! you break, Yolaine gonna devour your soul.

Latsufir: I'll get them done! Don't worry, (turn off portal temporarily. Okay. You called?

Gyouter: 2 minutes.

## Two minutes, and a quarter later. Inside house ground level, at the door
Gyouter: ... (saw movers) Alright, (open door), quick! 

(all movers in)..

Gyouter: (got all of them in, lock door) The portal is in basement. get all of them to inside!

### Explain Ironic Priest
> I gave him... Lamborghini, and then he was like

Josh Simanjuntak: NO!! In the name of Lord Jesus, Hai that demon, Away from the surface of earth!!!

> Idk, I didn't feel that my Father came and scold me lol. Heck, even Himself laughed because He knew, something gotta came
> Ironic 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣

Josh: (went to Lamborghini dealership)

> Josh regretted, hahahahahaha!!! And he know already I said `No second chance`, lmao!
> Luckily though, he had side business and got big revenue in it. So he can recoup his 'Pay later' in a moment.
> He got it accounted.

### Pause flashback
Gyouter: Okay, did he crash? driving speed car in public road is the worst idea racers could imagine.

Lucifer: Nah nope. Luckily did not. Josh is also a racing car fan, and he likes to play Gran Turismo latest generation everytime it releases. That's why I wanted to give him Lambo, but you see.

Gyouter: Alright.

### Continue flashback
James Hartono: Welcome, Lamborghini, anything I can help?

(Josh bought the Lamborghini with credit card a.k.a. Pay Later in which he already accounted the repayment trajectory carefully)

Josh: (Gas gas in neutral)! !

James: Careful driving, sir. the roads here are packed. You should not show off your speed.

Josh: Yeah, I know. That's why me and friends assembles in track.

James: Wow. Okay. Just be careful sir, alot of reckless scalped our cars these days only to be wrecked by the next week. You're the lucky one, because I recorded your face that I predicted you'll be careful.

Josh: 🤨?? Anyway, See ya. (casually go forward)

### End flashback
Gyouter: Okay. I thought something else would happen.

Lucifer: So, that is all the gifts I could give. Sorry, it's not that good this time. I could've give you even more weapons, black magics, etc. etc., but you see, everytime I do that my Father suddenly outta nowhere and you know, yourselves. Also, because you are human, or should I say, mortals, have regret feeling, these rewards cannot be rejected and will always be in your inventory, period.

Latsufir: Wait, what?!

Gyouter: Don't worry, we'll keep it.

Latsufir: Okay, fine!. I will regret, (go to bearers that gives hell bibles) now what's this bible? In the name Lord Jesus, protect me from danger etc., (open bible Volume 2018) Amen!... Oh my God, this text

Latsufir: 😬😳 I'm sorry, God, Sky, (close bible). Eeeegh.

Gyouter: Alright. Now, we're done. Lats, never seen you so judgemental today. You're the man of ideas, but I've never seen you judge so harshly. Is it because of the fact she is devil, or what?

Latsufir: I'm sorry, I just... Back when I was a kid, every birthday party, All gifts I got, are terrible. All that is is just Utensil, Office tools which also a School tools like pen, whatever poops was that, and uh... Fashion, what the peck even you're talking about. Anything but my dream!

Nubir: Honestly yeah. But's it's important. We also agree to angery here. We wish them come back. Pretty much.

Neshim: We even have hired paid visitor because, yeah pandemic. All health protocols, stuff like that, oh man. This is the most dangerous business we got to do despite it seems plain and supposedly natural.

Thomas: Oh wow, I'm surprised, but now I can connect sense, why there is Jakarta Fair, I heard there is no Jakarta Fair that time and for long. Even if so, it would've been off limit in counts, very restricted. I was very worried what the hell, Jakarta Fair during pandemic and that one not available, okay. NOw, for the reveal, (lift up hammer)... (smash the thumbnail)!!!

(DUAR)!!!!!

Thomas: Alright, what do we got here? Oh wow. what's this? [Flag of.. remorse..](https://github.com/Perkedel/After-Church/blob/master/RAW%20files/Inkscape/Week%20Strong/01-Flag-of-remorse-retry.png ), Wow, another cryptic heartbereak confession.

Grevor: That wasn't me, it *Manifested* somewhere, anybody did this?

(everyone says no that wasn't me)

Grevor: No, nobody of us. Probably came before this contract.

Thomas: Then this has to be Kaorfa, be patient, Joel. Oh look, more pictures too, and looks like he stop after he realize, that he could've join making FNF mods instead. What do you think?

Grevor: 😐?! 🧐🧐🧐🧐🧐🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔.. Okay. Mindblowing.

Thomas: Yeah, I hope Sky mod come back. Right, next! (take out another thumbnail)

![Week Meta thumb](https://github.com/Perkedel/After-Church/raw/master/RAW%20files/Inkscape/Week%20Strong/week-meta-thumb.png )

Thomas: This is for week Meta. that time when Hookx broke 4th wall to tell something matter that has been infuriating gamers in this FNF community.

Grevor: Oh yess, that one. Fun fact, to this day, it's still in embargo. Honestly, we are afraid if the public release was turns out to be a demo before launch, considering the Full Ass gonna come out real. No idea where should this would go.

Thomas: Okay, I see. I think I can expect less. (lift hammer)... (smash)!!!

(DUAR)!!!

Thomas: Yep. nothing. All I got here, (lift the truth card)..., UI musics. Not a big surprise, but yeah, a **hope**. Right, (take another thumbnail card) next..

![Week Merdeka Thumb](https://github.com/Perkedel/After-Church/raw/master/RAW%20files/Inkscape/Week%20Strong/week-merdeka-thumb.png )

Thomas: Okay, this is for Independence day of Indonesia, Earth. (lift hammer)... (nvm lift, cancel!) wait, no, don't (put hammer). (hands hold thumbnail) How do I politely (shake thumnail) open this?

(truth card fell)

Thomas: Huh? (put thumbnail card to left hand side), Okay. Huoh? Lot's of (take the truth card) tapes in here? What's going on?

Grevor: Oh yeah. Uh, Yeah so we want to celebrate Independence day for Indonesia of course. We intent to use canon version of Indonesia Raya but.. it got alot of confusing tempo dynamics. And our time is tight, must be around 17 August. We tried to find MIDI and sheets music to help us out, and try guessing tempo, but yeah. This gonna stretch our job. Luckily, Neshim told us, Kaorfa had library of MIDIs from [Didi Haryadi](http://songsindonesia.didiharyadi.com/national/index.html ) for which Didi had that Indonesia Raya MIDI cover. Of course, not the canon style we want, but easy to chart and no tempo dynamics. yyeah. We screwed up that time. It's terrible, but should be there.

Thomas: Okay, Lesson for today. No tempo dynamics allowed if there is no mirror MIDI file cover for it, or any tempo flow informations. Next... (take another thumbnail)...

![week Toxic Thumb](https://github.com/Perkedel/After-Church/raw/master/RAW%20files/Inkscape/Week%20Strong/week-toxic-thumb.png )

Thomas: Oh wow. This feels like... radioactive.

Grevor: Oh yeah that uh.. huuuuh yeah uh..

Thomas: NEFFEX - Are You Okay is copyrighted, not royalty free so you forcedly have to use this dummy song

Grevor: Yea yeah!

Thomas: One of GameBanana moderator gone rogue, bbpanzu got hacked on every aspect, Karenly takedown of curious case of Mid Fight Madness investigation, which was uh *Black Swordsman*, I forgot, but yeah.

Grevor: Yes yes, 😬😬 eeehh.. wait that offending guy was from before days.

Thomas: Oh okey, aand lastly, Twitter and maybe others, notorious for spoiled brats to assemble and create civil wars.

Grevor: Yess.

Thomas: ... Okay. Now, (lift hammer)... (smash thumbnail)!!

(DUAR)!!!

Thomas: (smoke everywhere) BFhuok! Uhuk! wuuHuk!!! Akh EM!!! Man, that smoke!!! God!..

Neshim: Probably dust which mods that gone, I supposed. Do you smell?

Thomas: Iya, OUHoukk! HHaaa. Iya iya... I smells like uh... (sneeze) HATCHI!!! (swipe nose), (vacuum nose)!, UugHH Dust soil, where man came back into, mixed with somekind of moon dust full of.. red onions.., (eye dusted) Ow, my eye! Jesus!

Jayce: (immediately vacuum clean the truth desk)!!

Yume Kamerline: Sir, override with this dust mask! (spray eyes with clean water)!!

Thomas: Yes, thank you.. (wear dust mask over current mask), (turn on voice amplifier), test test? okeh. So, uh these 3 cards okay. RIght uh..

Jayce: (clear up desk), (take out all truth cards and store to storage)..

Thomas: RIght, next (take another thumbnail)..

![DREADFUL thumb](https://github.com/Perkedel/After-Church/raw/master/RAW%20files/Inkscape/Week%20Strong/week-2021.11-thumb.png)

Thomas: Ouh, this feels like a cardboard.

Grevor: Oh yess that. wait, we do not do anything that time. We have vacations. Probably it was Kaorfa's own job.

Thomas: perhaps. probably.

Yusekor Umeren: uhhh 🙋‍♂️...

Thomas: Yes?

Yusekor: Uh, Kaorfa seems had published my chart. I was afraid, that song shall not be published because that could cause the Gamebanana page taken down and uh... didn't happen.

Thomas: Oh wait, You're the one that charted Ku Tetap Cinta Yesus unknown Piano MIDI cover?

Yusekor: Yes, uh we are! I do the conversion and trackline alignments, Diunib Cresento (async) the consultant and converted the vocals into each soundfont & finally we chart them together. It was a test. a very radioactive test.

Diunib Cresento: (H with windiest) Hhai.

Thomas: I see.

Yusekor: I swear! nobody of us publish this!

Thomas: Yeayea don't worry, don't worry. It was Kaorfa, I believe. He wants to send message again.

Yusekor: Okay. wheuw..

Thomas: Now, did you see the final result?

Yusekor: I have not, very afraid. I cried everytime. I'm gonna die, the world gonna end.

Thomas: It wasn't, Thancc God. So, let me tell you, the second player is instead a **Placeholder**. Now you should know what does the message means.

Yusekor: Ooh, okay.

Thomas: And please, don't regret that. that cover is Cool and Good. Amazing Awesome.

Yusekor: Thancc, I guess. Never in my life receive appreciation from anybody I never know.

Thomas: Now it's now. Alright, the last one. wait, forgot. (lift hammer)... (smash thumbnail)!!

(DUAR)!!!

Thomas: ... Right, as expected. Protoglin Amexamlef... Alfaheur. Okay, last one. (pick last thumbnail)

(it's empty with blue surgeon robe color background)

Thomas: Huh, it's empty? (cracks suddenly to pieces) whoa! ... Okay.

Grevor: Oh, that.. is not completed yet. You know, we have experienced technical difficulty, uh Unexpected Job Effort Escallations.

Thomas: Oh. I'm really sorry. What was the culprit?

Grevor: 3rd song.. We... want to convery seriously heartbreaking message.

Thomas: Uh huh.

Grevor: It's a piano play, manually. With..

Thomas: Skip it.

Grevor: I beg you pardon?

Thomas: **Skip it**.

Grevor: But.. why? we have to

Thomas: You can keep the message, (take 3rd truth card).. (lift and face it forward).. (Sigh callout towards cval_brown again) Okay, you can keep telling the message. But this must be the last time. No more.

Malore: But sir! We gotta let people know every new things, that's the purpose of this contract.

Thomas: Unfortunately, things must be violated. You see yourself, the more you want to revenge, the more you do it, the more desire to do even more. It's cancerous. If left uncut, it'll grow, to the point it's incurable, Hawking Drain hole. You will never stop. You will always calls everyone you see unfit to you, out. You will get hate, and you'll embrace it to counter and fuel more fires. Eventually [we become, what we behold](https://ncase.itch.io/wbwwb ). No difference with those spoiled brats on social medias of the world. The difference being, a video game. Yes, exciting, you are so unique but eventually, we are just an immature adults on Twitter who post karenly stuff on Steam, GOG, PlayStation, Microsoft, everywhere. Next level of toxicity, now in your nearest GameStop, Toko Game, etc.

Malore: ...

Thomas: Alright, I apologize disturbing your brains. But.. idk, I have to interfere before **we become what we behold**.

Nubir: What do we do now?

Thomas: Idk, have fun, stop talking about drama that happened in this FNF community, build positivity since there is no such, and uh.. have a dance off somewhere in IKEA? no, too obvious,

Grevor: I can think about that. But this is gonna be long, big effort.

Thomas: Okay, not soon. anytime.

Yusekor: Maybe I can have fun in here? We gotta have transition you know, like `bridge`! yess!

Thomas: Exactly.

Grevor: OKay, about this song.. I skip. Gonna empty it out but the message?

Thomas: Yeah just do it. I really concern if you have it delayed. everyone no matter how mannered customers will be, will always be infuriated. Doesn't count how many employee you had, delay.. (pose of got choked) QQQ! Don't let that happen.

Grevor: Alright, gonna scrap heartbreaking for now, replace with empty.

Thomas: Okay.. now these 2 (take both rest of truth cards).. First one here (left hand).. Okay, I agree with this one. I know, it's always.. Spicy for every criticsm. But it's essential to know the difference. Should've glad for which one that helps you fix the bug. And this second (right hand).. Oh yeah, this is spreading right now, posting memes in General channel, got you banned. Yeah, this intolerance.

Grevor: Oh yeah, the Public Relation division I heard has billed that. You can still post meme to this day, but this time it's officially allowed, and is illegal to punish just because of it. Of course, as long as it's not blasphemous.

Thomas: That's great! ... ... Right, uh we ran out. that's all.

Kofor Mul: Gyouter!!!

(everyone cheer he's back there he is)

Thomas: Oh, great, he and friends back. Right at the time

Gyouter: Afternoon, everyone. Whew. that was.. amazing. What did I miss here (look at the stage)... (saw truth desk with truth hammer)... (confirmed that it was Thomas leaked the Point secret to gamers & destroyed the protective censorship system) 🤨?! (go casually to the Thomas).. Hey, what you doing here>

Thomas: Oh hi.. It's been an honor, (look back) 😁🙂... (profused sweating, because indeed already leaked everything) eh,, I can explain..

Gyouter: Look, I do not want to revenge, so relax. Even if I am the one in charge, nah, why would I. I.. actually, this contract, not in charge. Kaorfa himself is. My role is to manage, watch, and moderate everything. And, how in the world you can leak all of our messages to gamers?

Thomas: Okay uh, first of, ... can I ... speak impolitely, as a best friend?

Gyouter: C'mon, we're best friend. go ahead.

Thomas: So, what the hell are you doing? You here right now doing callouts?

Gyouter: uhhh unfortunately, some kind of. BUt here, I wasn't the one that do that. I can only, reconciliate for any PR disaster, so as you can see, most of the message here are direct from Kaorfa, not me.

Thomas: Yeah, why would you. But, why keep going? Do you already forget, that you'll become what you behold if you don't interfere?

Gyouter: I would like to, but Kaorfa is under another huge depression in this sector here as you can see from the tragedy. How do I supposed to cope Joel?!

Thomas: I see. But, You are becoming what you behold. Firstly, you talk about Sky takedown, all this because of dramas over there, mistakes over there. It was drama this contract blames. So, what behold? the dramas. calling out dramas, eventually the person as this kid right here blocked Joel only for a simple stupid misunderstanding. Ah man, basically, you gotta veer off here.

Gyouter: Oh man, never been in my life dare to violate contract every single none even. Especially if that was under the lead of Kaorfa, don't mess with him. Speaking of mess with Joel, I am really impressed. You got no scratch at all attempting to crack open the truth towards enthusiastic Gamers. Joel would've kicked you out before you even entered this facility because Joel knew you're going to leak them all out. Do you think?

Thomas: Oh wow. you got the point. Well, it happens, let happened apparently. If this is it, then it gotta be Joel. I fell now, Joel is changing direction because...

Gyouter: He already detected that he could become, what he behold. That's why he let you leak them now.

Thomas: Okay. wow. How about the contract then? any special condition in it?

Gyouter: Let's see (open the contract page), typically, once the contract has been ran, Joel rarely ever intent to change it, unless it is critical. Now let's see..

Thomas: Oh wait, there is a special condition!

Gyouter: Wait, there is no such, before, what's this? `Kontraktua Majoris`?? Oh well.

Thomas: Uh, I still don't get it. We just have to wait, what Joel going to tell us about this.

Neshim: Hey!! Sir, Gyouter!! (send throw link to Gyouter phone)!!!

Gyouter: (open the [link](https://gamebanana.com/mods/354884 )) huh? 😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱 HOOH!!!?!?!??!?

Thomas: WHAT IS IT?!

Gyouter: (turn to show phone & pogchamp face)!!!, ... Kontraktura Majoris!!!

Thomas: 😮😮😮😮😮, **WAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA**

(everyone wondering why suddently Gyouter & Thomas struck with euphoria)?!?!?

Gyouter: (throw link to the giant screen, swipe up)!!!

(everyone sees that)!??!?!??!

# 🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎊🎊🎊🎊🎊🎊 HORRAAAAAAAAAAAAAAY  🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎊🎊🎊🎊🎊🎊🎊
Gyouter: Wai wai wait.. (throw also the [original link](https://gamebanana.com/mods/44214 ) to the giant screen) HAA!!!

# EVEN MORE HORRAY PRAISE THE LORD, OH PECKING FINALLY!!!
(25 Seconds later)...

Thomas: Oh yess, what's the contract purpose now?

Gyouter: Oh yess, forgot... (back to contract page)... Ho it's changed!!!

~~Tell the world happenings around us~~ Survive, until the prime, where modification goes available. Expect also the 4th generation of our [world framework](https://godotengine.org/ ), as soon when standard has been set.

Gyouter: Survive, till the full ass come, when you can Workshop it. That's easy.

Thomas: Now this world framework means.. Godot right?

Gyouter: Yes, probably. We have been notified by Viorfa, that it's going to come.

Thomas: Alright yess. Now... what shoyld we do now?

## Storage room
Latsufir: (Arrived to Sky's appartment cell)!! Alright, here we are.

Sky: (Arrived too)!! Ah yeah.

Latsufir: Alright, stay here. (go to front door)... (open front door), WHOAH!!! PECK!! HO My God! I forgot, it's shelfed so high, whew, Uh,.. (Page janitor to this room from the phone)! 

Yume: (receive pager)? (go to storage room) Yes sir?

Latsufir: Hey, Yume! come here, get me down here! Got something to talk to Gyouter!

Yume: Oh okay! (turn on mini forklift remotely), (set carriage position towards Latsufir)... Okay

Latsufir: (ride to the carriage caddy), Alright, stay here.

Yume: (put down carriage caddy and bring mini forklift towards storage door)...

## Back to command center
Latsufir: Gyouter, Gyouter!!

Gyouter: Oh yes, have you done your date?

Latsufir: No idea yet, but, little help please.

Latsufir: Exactly!

Gyouter: Oh okay.. uh... Ahei, we got something to do again here. So, excuse me

(everyone Yes, sir & return to work)..

## Salt flat world
(appartment cell teleported to this world)!!!

Latsufir: Alright, here we are!!!

Molin: Whoah!

Latsufir: Here is the appartment yey! Now, uh.. put it here.

Breng Togrib (crane operator): (slowly put the appartment to the ground)..... Touchdown.

Latsufir: Alright! (get off the crane)

(all families approach the cell)

Molin: Wow, would you at that? In person.

Sky: Dad?? (run to Molin)

Molin: Hai!! (catch Sky & hug)!!! Oh ho ho..

Latsufir: Oh yess, I got an idea. maybe we should build the basement here. You know, staying here all the time sounds like expecting trouble. I want this mobile! Yeah!

Molin: Oh.. so like, walking appartment?

Latsufir: Yess yess! Hermit crab, you know, the basement get out from ground to move!

Molin: Sounds like a great idea!!!

Gyouter: Oh yeah! Well, we got the best builders here, I'll call them

Latsufir: Yes please.

Tusuk: Hmm, Honestly, some of the props from the previous house won't gonna fit in the cell. SO yeah, build the basement, for now, We'll try our best to compact this in. Do you mind?

Yolaine: (thinking) 🤔

Molin: uh... Okay let me check, how big is the storage that time (go inside the cell), (check inside middle right side door)!, Oh wow. Why did I... No, the constraint was the fault. Sir, what do you think?

Tusuk: Let's see, any props you won't going to use everyday?

Molin: Ummm maybe clock tower, that's it. Oh uh.. Oppositely, I often use TV, laptop, handycam, wardrobe, and uh.. umm...

Tusuk: Alright, I should do now, may I? If you change your mind now, you can tell, and uh, use this (give [furniture lifter webbing harness](https://www.reddit.com/r/Perkedel/comments/sduxnm/vst3_files/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3 ) free of charge) bands, and this mover (give sets of [furniture mover jack](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07FBX4QXX/ ) free of charge as well).

Molin: Alright I guess.

Tusuk: Okay. Yo!! Got things to put in here!

(movers start picking up Molin's properties and putting them inside the cell storage and around the cell interior)

Bulok: (arrived in Salt world)!!

Gyouter: Over there, ask Latsufir.

Bulok: Yes, sir. (go ask Latsufir)... Excuse me, sir.

Latsufir: Oh you came! alright. This appartment. Here.

Bulok: Okay then. (call builders) Yo!! (point to the appartment) start building basement!!!

Pocingklik Normaz: Amazing!

Zumi: Yeah, I know, it's not perfect. No idea what to build more with, I'm still nervous to get more you know!

Pocingklik: I know. I just uh... Maybe you should try the other one. Remember we've heard there was one Amexamlef came back? Perhaps we can help gamers know there is new version, by porting legacy to here, how about that?

Zumi: Great idea!, well uh complicated. we gotta tell Gyouter about(interupted)

Nurb: (knock door)! ! !! Hey!
