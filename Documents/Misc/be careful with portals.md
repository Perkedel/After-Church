# Be Careful with Portals

Cutaway for Family Guy Inspired

## Pre-cutaway

A: Dude. You must check your computer surrounding every occasionally. Portals now exist, combined with Bad USB, sure attackers from dimensions would learn.

## Begin

Owner Guy: What the fuck is going on with my computer? (Saw text file) What is this?!

Assistant: Umm open it up? It's a `txt` file..

Owner: (double click `READ NOW .TXT`)! !..

(ASCII art of computer back connected with Flipper, with arrow pointing to that Flipper)

Assistant: It's computer box, pointing the back

(Suspense hit)

Owner: (immediately check back)!!!

(A Flipper indeed connected to back USB port, with Post It attached, picturing middle finger f888 you and bottom text `SEBRANG` meaning across your house)

(Skip to Owner hunts across his front house) (camera close up to face from below)

Owner: (running to across)!!!!

(Camera from back owner face to menacing attacker)

(Camera from back of leaker face owner)

Leaker: (finished copying paid 1 M Kvz & private 3D models and uploaded it to sparsdat site)

(Camera while from attacker zoom to owner)

Owner: You!.. (walk towards angrily anf going to snap his neck).. .. ..

(Camera sit behind right owner shoulder face to attacker)

Leaker: (open portal underneath feet & fall back home)!

Owner: NO! (try to hug catch)

Leaker: (close portal)

Owner: (failed to catch) NOO!!. **HAAAAAAAAAAAARGGHHH.....**

Info: This imaginary scene could happen anytime, almost.

## post-cutaway

B: You don't tell them. Now they got the idea, wtf?!

A: Hey, remember Java Minecraft attack? Apparently some managed to try that Apache logger (`log2j`) exploit, it did. Coz it's been long time and gosh, has all been patched fully?
