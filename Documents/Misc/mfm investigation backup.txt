People sad to see this mod went privated and wished it to be public again, according to kuroao_anomal's GB profile
There is no enough information regarding the reason why. Apparently it seems kuroao_anomal had none of the submissions public here anymore.


Presumption
Because we are staying home (citation) due to COVID-19 pandemic, then more people are into the internet. Problem is, there never been exist manner education for social media on any school anywhere which it is sad to see that such essential education subject especially for those who just begun to interact with societies (i.e. young people, primary school or earlier). as a result, many of people speak unmoderated. not to mention, most people hate to be intervened by parents while going to internet, and went mad whenever they got parent in the room spying on the monitor either remotely or physically. Well yeah, they act before thinking. nobody watching them, and nobody wants to be watched by parents. If they want to speak bad, they just do it.
