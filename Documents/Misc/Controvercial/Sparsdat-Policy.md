# Dasandim Parliament releases new Sparsdat Policy!
Conclusion
- It's legal (only in Dasandim and most Sloantim planets)
- but we put limitation of course
- so it won't be abused

# Definition
## Sparsdat
an act of republishing asset to another site for free of charge in which such original asset was published on the original price for certain charge.

# Agreement
## Sparsdat is allowed
but with terms and condition

# Terms & Condition
## Promise for resupport back
Spardaters and leechers must resupport back if assets providers
- is not partial
- do not place leak-trackers either hidden or visible
- do not care for sparsdat
- encourage sparsdating for certain reason (e.g. trouble making site, agape kindness, etc.)

# Penalty
## actively against resupport back
Spardaters & leechers that not only forget but also against resupport back even if such assets providers are not that evil will be punished by times of violation
- 1st time = prison 3 month and/or fine Kvz 5000 (Rp 5 Million) with Crossban Education of Asset Appreciation package
- 2nd time = prison 6 month and/or fine Kvz 10000 (Rp 10 Million) with Crossban Education of Asset Appreciation package
- 3rd time = prison 12 month and/or fine Kvz 20000 (Rp 20 Million) with Crossban Education of Asset Appreciation package
- 4th time and so on = prison indefinite (decidable to unprison) month and/or fine Kvz all of them (Rp all of them Million) with Crossban Education of Asset Appreciation package

note that simply forgoting to resupport back while do not actively against resupport do not count as violation. Also for them wishing to resupport back but unable to do right now, shall be appreciated, as they'll eventually start resupporting.

note 2 that following above works for Dasandim genetic family for now. These penalty are still under debate due to complexity of understanding if this is not ironic.

# Termination
## Forget resupport
Sparsdaters and leechers are legally allowed (feel free) to forget resupport back if assets providers
- is partialism (micro-transaction)
- places leak-trackers either invisible or visible (that includes DRM)
- care for sparsdat and had DMCA related action against sparsdating
- actively insulting, bullying, and death-wishing sparsdaters for sparsdating
- actively had measures for paywalling every single things they made, even the silliest ones and had no willing to reopen the wall in later time
- had the old assets aged for 15 years and appears to be absent in activity nowadays
- ~~has already defunct, and/or diseased in the next 40 days after the event~~ maybe later
- above but then (found out) handed over the assets to another alive providers so that the paywall (and copyright) is perpetual
- Open sourced just the engine without the actual levels in it (so it's empty and you'll still have to buy the original software) in the next 2 years
