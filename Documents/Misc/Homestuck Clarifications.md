# Homestuck Fanfiction clarification

Ahei, gamers. Welcome. My name is JOELwindows7 (Joel Robert Justiawan) & yess, I am the Kaorfa of this Perkedel Cinematic Universe.

Now, thancc for your question in regards of the Homestuck side of our stories in here this universe now we got them dwells. We shall then begin to clarify.

## Clarifications

### All Characters we have yoinked have been cured & upgraded

Using *cheating* resurrection technologies we have, notably directly through Saorfa, our moderators.

Notable Characters:

- Vriska Serket. ReSTEMed left eye, complete with 6 side pupils as well.
- Tavros Nitram. ReSTEMed & Recovered serveral part of `c` somewhere back bone modules (which the damage causes paraplegic), & upgraded his leg strength to be as strong as bull, & also at will walk silently with `SilentStep`.
- Terezi Pyrope. While her eyes already healed in the original stories, we added extra ability such as `Tactile Skin` so she can scan the environment with touch like Star Nose Mole. Additionally others such as `Smell Stroncc`, etc.

### This franchise had been yoinked as is

due to the complexity, reverse-back-forth, multi-branching timelines, unfortunately, we are unable to simply fork from where canon it has been, due to its design (Git Forking will only start from which branch & where commit you started forking from). Therefore, all important elements have been yoinked manually, looking 1 to 1 from the original story, its sequels, & especially fan collected intels.

Additionally, Perkedel Technologies admits that our venture in this franchise has only recently started few times ago. However some few amiss and mistake shall be neglectable since these moments are usually either filler, or recoverable situations. So don't be sadd if you late joining the fandom, me too! I never have been for it this one! I was just a regular kid who has been suffering in school days & lacks internet connection all the times before things have reduced their costs.

### Variants have been merged into one each

in original story, you have seen that there are variants of each character, right by timeline difference, clones, and resets. Even often times we witnessed that some characters are paradoxially existed, which already on itself broke our forker. Basically it violates every aspect of Git work mechanism.

Therefore due to such quirk in this franchise, we have painstakingly review each and everyone of the entities & merge the duplicates into one, ensuring no memory loss & no unwanted behaviour damage during the process.

So now, when you hear e.g. Roxy Lalonde, by default you are looking at a woman whose a mother of Rose Lalonde. Of course, with better behaviours. This also goes for Alternians / Trolls as well. Condesce / Betty Crocker **= Meenah Peixes**. Any possible paradoxial situation has been removed, & will be reconnected under brand new moments or any fix methods.

Whew! my brain explodos! **ðŸ¤¯ðŸ¤¯ðŸ¤¯ðŸ¤¯ðŸ¤¯ðŸ¤¯ðŸ¤¯ðŸ¤¯ðŸ¤¯ðŸ¤¯ðŸ¤¯ðŸ¤¯ duar!!!**
