# 3D Model Dis or Dat

Part of the episode in You Don't Know Jack somewhere.

Controvercy: calls out paywallist featured.

## Is there the Blender Model?

Host: I have questions. (category)? And oh no, it's **Dis or Dat**.

(Play segue)!

Host: I'm going to give 7 characters in here. You need to pick if:

- There is the Blender model of it! or
- There is such Blender model of it ðŸ—¿.

Host: Think fast, you only have a few seconds to pick either `exist` or `not found`. Will begin, great luck. Wait wait, remember, that does not include ones reuploaded & neither that requires you join chat group btw.

### Dis Dat

- Krystal. Dis. WarefareMachine (Victor Suarez)
- Shantae. Dis. Rafa Knight 
- Protogen. Dis. Nukude
- Bullied Blind Girl. Dis. popopoka_
- Glamrock Freddy. Dat. Lukasz Borges, requires join Discord.
- Ioniq Sky. Dat. JOELwindows7, based on Michael (bfwifesforever) & bbpanzu, haven't modeled yet, including the IONIQ 5 gratis itself.

Host: Looks like the result is decent enough. (lowest score) But not this one. It appears that you are new to this game. I mean, that game, the context of Dis or Dat above.

Narator: (lowest score indeed) Here's your screw. Use this screw to screw all other players and make them have difficulty answering.

Host: When the question appears, you quickly press screw and all other players who got screwed will be given out of many difficulties. Every player wrong, grants you extra cash. Use this sparingly.

## What the hell, it's paid!

Host: Look at this, (category)! and it's **Dis or Dat**!!!

(play segue)

Host: Oh, look. It appears that it's a follow up from previous round's Dis or Dat, questioning about 3D Model existence. Now, replacing off the character that got no Model download publicly with ones existed, are 7 of these:

- Costs Nothing at all! or,
- Costs exorbitantly much! orrr
- BOTH.

Host: Be quick, coz you got only few seconds to pick between `Gratis` or `Paywalled` or `BOTH`. Again, not including lost or reuploads, great luck.

Host: Wow, pretty impressive isn't it? (lowest score) Nope, not this one.

Narrator: (lowest score) It's okay to be succ. Here's your screw. Use this to screw all other players.

Host: When question appears you gotta screw button quick. This will make all other players have difficulty answering. Right! moving on.
