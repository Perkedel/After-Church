# Keyholding training

In Dasandim, every personal data in their ID card are encrypted and can only be decrypted by the wallet owner themselves. It is a careless act to forget your password, lose your seed, and private token. If they did, then when they wanted to register or renew something, they will have to fill data which can take minimum 5 hours.

Here in Crossban, people who needs the training are trained to hold they keys tight like it's their core, if lose they'll die.
