# Who are Maryam Andla & Tina Dulun?

And how could Perkedel dare to insert LGBT moments here? Did they forgot that they would also be subject to meteor shower like Sodom & Gomora?

Maryam Andla & Tina Dulun are Vevtorican, from Vevtorica planet in Sutelyon system. These are some of the LGBT members of Vevtorica. They were banished from their own home because rejecting the agenda their government issued. Basically to harden everyone who disagree with their woke agenda of LGBT, simple. Maryam & Tina & families are thoughtful to reject this agenda for ironic intolerance. 

They all escaped from planet, and the government banded together with neighbouring planet to hunt them down. When they were chased, an agent shot their dimension beam, causing them to travel to random dimension, but luckily, they lost and can no longer be found. They happened to land on an Experimental Dimension. Crazy, considering Experiment dimension is highly classified and nobody but Kaorfa and high authorities knows & can access. Only chosen people can enter and do activities, but leaking it won't cause anything, because Kaorfa is kind, unlike many silicon techs, but as long it does not destroy reputation of course.

The people rescued them and fostered them. They like it. And when the people offered new home, they decided to not to go and stay here forever, due to how impossibly high security this dimension is.
