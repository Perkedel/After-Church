## Pre-cutaway example

B: Seriously. Nobody likes to be forced to join unless you gave them some candy in return. Perhaps make it like if he's not join he'd be dead, something something.

## Begin

Jaquor Morak: (crawling towards end of hole) ugh!!, UGH!!!,

Gerald Jacobin: GUys! (async) (pull Jaquor)

(skipped to prepared smugled Jeff's laptop from confiscate room)

Bastangor Uchakaka: Sir? (escort Jeff)

Jeff Moore: Ah, here we go. All we do here is just (show python part that has the malware) snip up this script into our simple plugin. When they use this plugin, the real script will run. Of course, decoy must work so it's hard to tell.

Bastangor: Will it get busted?

Jeff: That's right, but don't worry, it won't be long. I'll take it off later and put it again on my next plugin. But ehh, people just forgot to update plugins am I right?

Bastangor: Ohh

Jeff: It's simple, you just market it to people. Want to Join or not?

Bastangor: (afraid to be killed) Yes yes, I'm joining.

*everyone*: (follow step, afraid to be killed)!..

Jeff: Good. Now find potential modellers here. Target only those who never share the file.

Bastangor: I know some.

Jeff: Good then target them.

Bastangor: Okeh..

Jeff: What are you looking at?

*everyone*: (back to scamming quickly)!!..
