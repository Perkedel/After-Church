Cutaway family guy inspired

## pre-cutaway

A: like having an accident, and one's solution to puzzle does not apply in reality.

## begin

### Hallway

Nurse guy: (hastily carrying medicines in each bottle)...

Info: patient is prescribed 2 medicines. A & B. Both tablet had same look, different chemistry. Patient must exactly consume 1 A & 1 B. No less, no more. Mistakes will kill him.

Guy: (async) (tripped over a medical cart) WHOAH!! (Medicine dropped)!!

Nurse gal: (async) (tripped by fellow nurse guy) AAA!!

Guy: Oh my God, I'm so so so sorry

Gal: (retidy) It's okay, I am also in a hurry.

Guy: (looking medicine)... (medicine scrambled) BLOODY HELL!!!

Gal: What's happening?

Guy: (reorient both vials), NO, no, no no no no oh no oh no... (recap both vials), (B vial is empty, vial A still had 1 tablet), haaaargh......

Gal: Hey, atleast all of them are still in tray, right,

Guy: Not just that, I... I must exactly give him exact amount, frickin unbelievable. ... Uh, Oh I know, 

Gal: What is it?

### Memory

Concocter: Slice them in half. If there was an error, at least you can correct it soon.

### end Memory

Guy: (take out Xacto pen knife), (slide all medicine in half, except 1 still in vial A), okay.. (continue)

Gal: Wait, you sure about that?!

### Room

Guy: Here you go, sir.

Patient: You bafoon! You scrambled the medicine!

Guy: My apology, sir. I have tripped. These are the only stock we have currently, the newer ones comes next week.

Patient: Ugh. Okay, fine. (Consume A full), (drink), (take a half on mix), (drink), (half mix), (drink), (half mix), (drink full).... ah. Ncp chp, well I don't.. (dies)!!

Info: He took 1½ A & ½ B. Wait, that still kill him?!
