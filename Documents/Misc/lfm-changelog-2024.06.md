image thumb idea: We sold this mod to X0p1r4t3 Eenvreensment, here's explanation

# Last Funkin Moments: Reactive

After we have temporarily suspended our contract due to Kaorfa's side job, we have witnessed that the day still becomes incondusive, unfortunately, as usual it is.

And Spoiler alert, I decided to graduate 90% of Wakturia workforce here, because the day has been incondusive to me. I cannot further risk this, because being banned for the ***rights*** is not a good idea at all. I shall keep my accounts alive as long as possible. I asked why it's down, deleted. I asked what's kenny is all about, blocked. We hoped that this one last out three mods here to come back just like previous two, nothing come back ever. And other things right in here, and everywhere. I thought some particular talented creators & high order people there are nice, they aren't. Really I am disappointed with you all.

You may see nothing in where you stand right now, but you should see the rubbles I have collected in where the Cause stands. Mind you that these rubbles as always will not be shipped with the main binary to ensure that it is legal for everyone.

Edit: Kaorfa has been laid off. the manager for Kaorfa's side job is currently requesting position and still haven't got news to this day.

### Pre

Gyouter Embinosa: Hey again. Uh.. may I come in to your palace? Something very important. Thanks.

### Begin

#### X0p1r4t3 Eenvreensment Trade Center

Info: Roig Hermalansa come down from stair from Automotive topmost floor. Gyouter, followed by friends come out from that stair.

Roig Hermalansa: (turn around), C'mon gamers, over here! (turn around again & continue walk, pose walk `let me show you`)............

Info: while walking

Gyouter Embinosa: (The mall is so giant and has deep floor upon the gap of balcony) Whoow..

*everyone*: (follow)

Roig: See? it's pretty cool. Our mall here houses every kind of wild businesses, from just retailing, to whole sets full entertainments. Of course, Everyone needs to eat, including me!, So.., We house foods too. So big, so many, SO messy, had to put it on a special lobe.

Gyouter: 'Right?

Roig: That's right. Our mall separates chunks of purpose into different lobes. This lobe is Retail Trading lobe. Trades in a rolling door. Like..

Gyouter: ITC Cempaka Mas, Indonesia, Earth.

Roig: Mmm, I wanted to say Tanah Abang, but yep, correct. This infact, is inspired from such type of shop, cells with rolling door each. Flexible options, easy to adapt. We want to fit as many as possible here, so who knows you found a business that turns out very needed when times want it. God wants it, yess.

Gyouter: Okay. How do you gamers supposed to like, e.g. handles package deliveries. Coz this gets in way.

Roig: We handled it. Back doors 👉 right there, is where they go. They will go there, not here, coz this is designed for customers. Thaat.., after, has docks. Like marine trade docks, but land. Cars and trucks pack and unload stuffs back and forth. Though that is small, we got parking lobe beside here, and the middle also has docks too. Well, either way, no small parts. All options, flexibilities for maximum Efficiencies.

Gyouter: Wow. Got to visit this for eons to hang for this.

Roig: Mmm idk about that. And that's... how my best friend, designed it. What do you think?

Gyouter: I'm impressed. I think there are more fascinating features to see, too close in time for just a day.

Roig: We got everything. Now, there's the lift there, and YEy! Finally, the lift is working, and is now ready.

Info: 10 meters remaining

Gyouter: (notice there are 8 lifts instead of typical a pair) Yoo!! 8 lifts side by side?!

Roig: Got to anticipate for storms, folks. Tho no need to worry about it anymore, we have set a rule, to item NOT with this. 32 lifts for item just for them instead.

Gyouter: Side by side?

Roig: 2 hallways. left right. 8 on each wall. (Press go down between 3rd and 4th) so 4 of the walls. the center blunt each are reserved.

Gyouter: Whoaaah.

Roig: Never repeat what happened with my first time visiting my best friend's palace here. Wooh, I hate walking down escalator.

Gyouter: Yeah. ........

Roig: This lift big enough, forgot size, but the stuff ones back there is much bigger. Can fit 4 SUVs in 1 lift.

Gyouter: Buset!!

Roig: And tight 'em up with 2 Harley Davidson on the side where space still left. Tetris!! Like the 2 Straight Lines and 4 boxes.

Gyouter: Wehh....

*everyone*: (looking around)...

Gyouter: Wow, it's so long. How many floor?

Roig: Damn I forgot again. Sorry, new here. But's it's alot. Just be patient, they're just carrying people from ground (saw the lift 3rd arrived) Ah there you are. Go to the ground floor. no lower. The special thing is at that floor, exclusive.

Gyouter: Okay, people?

*half of everyone*: (enter the lift).

Gyouter: How many fit?

Roig: Well, half of these.

Gyouter: 'Kay wait, gotta wait for the rest. Now go, Ground!

Roig: (looking)... (felt another lift, look back there)?, (5th lift arrived) Hey, use this one.

Gyouter: Oh kay good!

*rest half*: (enter)...

Gyouter: (enter) Right.., (so tight) euggh..

Roig: (cannot come in, full, so stay) Okayy, good.

(lift closes & go down)

Gyouter: (tightened) Ground pls...

Yuob: (press `G`)!

Info: 7th lift arrived

Roig: Alright! (enter 7th & go to ground)

#### Ground Floor

Info: Gyouter & friends has came out of the lifts. Roig then come out of the 7th lift.

Roig: Okay friends. Now follow me again. (lead them to the special lift back there like before)

*everyone*: (follow)

Gyouter: (follow) Alright..

(Zoom overall).... (view upon the special lift)

Roig: (walk & stop at the right side of wall)., After you.

Gyouter: This would be it? (enter)..

*quarter of everyone*: (enter)

Info: And so on

#### Level B14. Giant Truth Research Facility Basement

Info: Everyone arrived. Gyouter walks out in awe, as the vault is a beauty ponders.

Roig: (come out of lift)..., And this is it. The Research Center. Now, go proceed, to the door.

*everyone*: (follow slowly while pondering the giant beauty)....

Gyouter: (walk slowly too) Man. You guys have a reaaally seriously impressive

**(giant light turns on with that loud Hollywood knocker)!!**

<!-- see 2022.05 -->

Gyouter: (surprised jumpscared) HEAAA!!!, YESUS TUHANKU!!! KAGET GUE APA ITU?!

Roig: Oh my apologies., That's the Hollywood knockers. It's very loud. Not only to replicate giant lights in every film, but to also notify if the lamp has just turn on, or off. Very important, especially hard of vision, must know too.

Gyouter: 🗿🗿🗿🗿🗿🗿🗿🗿🗿.... I mean yeah, there's a fun having it... Got to be this loud?

Roig: Oh, some little of hard of hearing too. Originally, this LED just ONs, and no sound. Disappointing. Ask Admiral. And turns out, it helps our scientist that had some difficult times. Win win!.. .

Gyouter: Okay then. Well, What do we do here? How to get in?.

(camera look to the smaller door right of the giant door)....

Jallopy Ometamnasir: (open the small door).... (look), Ahei Wakturians? You're on time! Hop in!

*everyone*: (get in)!!!

Gyouter: Hmm (get in)...

Roig: (also get in)

#### Giant Truth Main Hallway

Roig: Okay..

Jallopy: (close)...!, (lock again)!

Roig: Friends, this is Jallopy. He's your driver for the trams you'll use to tour today. He runs the trams in this facility.

Jallopy: Sup, gamers?

Roig: Now, before we are going about the business discussion. There is first something I'd like to show you. Let's hop in the train, and enjoy.

Info: uses bottom trains.

*everyone*: (get in tram from back first then front)

Gyouter: (get in the front most of the front Tram)

Jallopy: (enter to right driver seat)!, Oh yeah.., (greet Gyouter handshake) Hi. my name is Jallopy Ometamnasir. Nice to meet you.

Gyouter: (reply hanshake in this too) Gyouter Embinosa. Nice to meet you meet you too.

Jallopy: (look back) Hello gamers!

Roig: (take back most in back train)

*everyone*: (lazily hi hello wave hand) haai..

Jallopy: Okay, so now, we're first going to the left. Enjoy the ride, wear your seatbelt. Here we go! (run the tram)....

Gyouter: (enjoy the view)...

Roig: As you can see right here. This area here is a craft of an artist here. For just only few years did he done it. Well, of course still lot more needed to do. But we have what we have now.

Gyouter: What are you guys doing here?

Roig: Everything, to be explained later. Most importantly, to collect & foster works. Find ways to recover works, recollect the loss and further prevent losses. I mean, this sounds evil like cliché. But why should we care? Things gone. Zumi said, if ones fails to keep it, then others shall help, or have the work doomed to loss, void. The null.

Gyouter: Sounds familiar.

Roig: It is. These days gamers across the galaxies have this concern. And opposition strives to keep it for themselves, and expect anything and whatever in return, even that would kill someone. Anything, not just vaccines, but also... many.

Gyouter: I wish we can do help. ... But we're under pressure. You sure this is a good idea? don't you be afraid if our opposition one day meet us?

Roig: I am. We are. But it's worthless to fear, when things gets lost. Somebody had to take care of it, once again.

Gyouter: Yeah. Unfathomable those people in opposition.

Roig: BeyOoonnnd Salvation.

Info: reached upon the front Lab vault room, turn left first. Right later, residential space.

Jallopy: (steer turn left) Okayyewittwu...

(Rail Rattling)

Info: Then go all the way to the left Hallway. Until dead end, you turn right.

Gyouter: What's your dream?

Roig: Which dream?

Gyouter: Biggest ones.

Roig: Ah.. I think I only have 1 or which is... everything is never gone. I mean.. no I mean, the creative works. I was thinking about Games, it was so expensive. I wish.. that ee.. not paid.

Gyouter: (staring)....

Roig: I wish..., AAA games, costs $0, no IAP, no ads, just free. Aand Open Source, Full version. Full game free. Full game and free. Three. You know.. I mean, AAAAlll types of games. Free, Open Source, and Full version.

Gyouter: Hmmm... So you used to sparsdat games right?

Roig: I do. I have no regrets. No guilt. They are a888888 making it paid.

Gyouter: Hmm?

Roig: Story's so long. But luckily my parents and my best friend and his parents all here. safe and sound. Me got to escape to a junk dimension full of threats everyday. But you came. Thank you.

Gyouter: With pleasure. I know it's not me, but other set of friends. But we are one.

Roig: Yeah.. ... What about you? did you sparsdat?

Gyouter: Once. But I have regrets, full guilts. I think I have huerted their hearts. So weeks later, I deleted it. Never to be seen again.

Roig: It's okay. Sometimes, it's confusing. It was merely simple, they their hearts into it. Nowadays, ... it's not worth looking for, especially ONE. ONE guy there. Now, who opened my eyes here? it was Gabe Newell. You know?

Gyouter: You mean Steam?

Roig: Oh yeah, my parent thankfully is so humble, but also scared, what if the card would overcharge? Thankfully not, unless you're hacked. That.. is when my eyes opened. Zumi is right!, Buying games legit is easier than sparsdating! Pay, install, play. That's it.

Gyouter: Was that that simple tho? Do you have any other 3rd or 4th eyes opened?

Roig: Hmm what is it? Oh yes, uhhh the `they put their hearts to it`.., and `not`.

Gyouter: Okay, you mean that

Roig: Digital Restriction Management.

Gyouter: Right!

Roig: `You have to put the CD into your computer`., to `You have to start the Steam first`.

Gyouter: yea yea yea yea...

Roig: There has been alot of cases of verification requirement these days, reducing the experience I expected for. Once again, Sparsdat becomes easier, especially when developer put extra DRMs into it. Also.. it was just so merely fortunate, the legit purchase could be reached easily without hassle, that's the point of all it right? Yeah. Stuff like that.

<!-- talk about CD Projekt Red betrayal under Cyberpunk Liberty, Galaxy must be used -->

Gyouter: Hey got news for you. Bad news. No it's rumor. new DLC of Cyberpunk hearingly requires Galaxy launcher. Lie about DRM free, no more the Liberty people looking for.

Roig: Oh yea really? Wait.. No way... CD Projekt Red no....

Gyouter: I'm sorry, I hate to bear bad news, but this.... yeah.. Haven't tested ourselves but.. yeah.

Roig: People's oath wears eventually. We're trying our best to not let that happen. But games, no longer our business anymore, unless they're gone. Yeah, we only.... share what did gone, and sometimes the overdues that also gone. That's all. If they have to be paid, it's on them. We'll ask Kaorfa to hire ones that can make clones about it. Try even better.., even if it is worse and unfamiliar.

Gyouter: mm......

Info: Dead end with left & right hallway. Turn right

Jallopy: (steer turn right)..

(Rattling Rail)!!....

Jallopy: Okay we're going to see the guard.., ..... (stop tram before the smaller door)

Gyouter: What's this?

Roig: Thick door. Security measures. We can design barriers how they placed.

Gorgam Harkman (Siru Magomalen's husband): (unlock), (open the small door inward upon the wall).... (swoop in and look)... Hey.

Gyouter: Ahei.

Roig: These are the guest.

Gorgam: Okay. (swoop off and hold onto the door), come in.

Jallopy: (continue)..

Gorgam: (road officer style go go go)....

Jallopy: Thanks buddy.

Gorgam: You're welcome.

Info: finished the Tram in

Gorgam: (close), (lock)!

Roig: The real facility is intentionally I made it U turn, to make it hard for enemies to run into.. at least there is.

Gyouter: Hmmm okay.

Roig: Hang in there, we're almost there. one right turn, and go, upon 2 thick doors I closed, there it is.

Gyouter: So big...

Roig: Never knew how much less could you ended up with. So there you have it.

Gyouter: So what's in there.

Roig: We are working on a project. It's big. For all gamers, across the universe. But not for Proprietarist, and other evil gamers that strives losses.

Gyouter: Exciting!..

Roig: (internally perturbed upon lack of resources) Yeaah.., pretty exciting. I'm sure you are very hyped to see it.

Info: Now, intersection with straight, back, and right. go to right.

Jallopy: (steer turn right)...

(Rattling)!!!

(cam zoom far and look from right side of train)..

Roig: As you can see, you gamers are the first and only, whose given exclusive access to this project here. This I mean.. I wish I can open it up to all of you gamers, coz that's our goal. To have all gamers enjoy creative works while it lasts, and foster & appreciate all the names that made these creative works, even either or both is impossible. Again, Oppositions always try to obstacles us and often times euthanizes many of us. No need to think, you know the drill. (finger point forward) Over there, before that thick door I closed 2 of them, left there, **is the Booty.**

Gyouter: **Yarr!!**

Roig: Ah haa haa haahaa.... Yep! Juust few hundred meters more.

Gyouter: You gamers maintain these?

Roig: Oh yess. But only few Zumi selects, coz.. it's the big deal. Can't have any coins shared, otherwise it's the opposition could be the one that gets it (and track and hunt us down). NO no no. Maybe later. Now.. keep it here, until one day.. no Punishment.

Gyouter: I see.

Roig: Now, about your contract. It got very interesting back story in it. What's with that?

Gyouter: Kaorfa witnessed loss of an FNF mod. That particular one he lost, is personal.

Roig: Personal?? Oh... Personal.. Yess.. Of course.

Gyouter: Thankfully that 2 are back, only 1 that to this day, didn't come at all.

Roig: (nod) I see I see. (stop nod) .... .... Now that we own it, can we do anything with this? I mean... to install everything we have here.

Gyouter: Well sorry, not yet. That's what our discussion after this. Can we yoink assets? No permission, like that.

Roig: Oooooooh, okay. ... ... okay, yeah.

Gyouter: We're tired. Have we really got to do this? We just put it here or something, keep names.

Roig: Yess... that infuriation. ...

Jallopy: Gamers, we're about to arrive. Check your belongings!

*everyone*: (check belongings)!!

Gyouter: (also check)..., Okay..

Jallopy: (stop by the Kolmorotzzet)

Roig: Okay! (get off excitedly to the left) Here we are!! C'mon let's go!! I'm excited yey!!

*everyone*: (take off seatbelt & off to the left)

Gyouter: This it?

Roig: C'mon, let me show you my booty! our booties!

Gyouter: Well, I wonder what could be.

Roig: Of course it's not physical gold. Files! That's right. (take keyring from right pocket).... (success)!, (selecting Kolmorotzzet door key).... (success) ah!, (poke insert to the door keyhole) okay..

Gyouter: Wait, simple house key??

Roig: Oo yeah. I'm not going to repeat same mistake again. So fortunate we remembered Kriff the Krillantz, got all back. Not gonna do that unecessary encryption again! (unlock the door)....

Gyouter: Oh..

Info: Joel's homework folder was encrypted because fear her mom would find out. Alas, as his OS damaged and must reinstall again, the encryption key is gone, so are the files. Luckily, before he encrypt, he entrusted the `pfx` backup to Kriff the Krillantz, and bind oath him to keep this backup safe. Thought lost forever, but Kriff kept his promises and Blead Creat is saved. Never encrypt your homework folder. Spread it! you gotta be adult also.

Roig: (success) Okay, (open)!, Come in!

*everyone*: (come in)!!

Gyouter: (come in little slow)....

Roig: (enter)!!... (close door), ah yess. Tada! here's the booty!

Gyouter: (just an external harddisk) Wait. That's it?

Roig: eeh..

Gyouter: I thought the room is going to be file server of something. (look upon widest empty space) look at this, echo!!!

...

(no echo)

Gyouter: Huh?

Roig: Hold on, (temporarily turn off forcefield barrier) try again.

Gyouter: Echo!!

echo

echo

echo

echo

echo

Roig: (turn barrier back on).

Gyouter: (look Roig) Really?

Roig: Okay listen. Uh.. we lack resources. Importing is so much. And per TB to here from Earth would be.. exponential. Now it's full! Nowhere to go, Files we didn't get must've been gone by now, Congratulations!

Gyouter: Ouch man..., I promise. We'll soon get you out of here.

Roig: Thanks man. I'll hand this over to Zumi.

Gyouter: So.. now what do we have here?

Roig: (swiup finger point to right PC) Check out this interface here. (go to it)

*everyone*: (follow and look together)

Gyouter: (2 folder window side by side) What are these?

Roig: So.. we got [MIDI](https://github.com/Perkedel/Personal_MIDI-Collection).., and [Kolmorotzzet](https://gitlab.com/perkedel/kolomorotzzet).

Gyouter: (profanity detected)??!!!, 'scuse me??!

Roig: Umm no that.. My apologies.. but the.. it's pronouced like that. like in.. *OH PECK NECK, OUR FILES ENCRYPTED AND THE KEYS ARE GONE!!*.... Get it?... Okay Anyway..,

Gyouter: (back to topic focus)

Roig: So we have 2. This Kolmo is main. The MIDI got separated for historical reason, when Kaorfa plays lots of MIDI. His dad sorted the file. He decided to start git this, later the main Kolmo. Yeah. 2 of 'em.

Gyouter: Okay. So.. any plan, or whatever this is?

Roig: No idea yet. We only backed it up so far. And no idea about when is it safe. I think MIDI would be one that is.

Gyouter: Okay. ... Can beta tester join?

Roig: Of course!! ... But limited. uh.. you have to.. ask Kaorfa. And for this time, is not easy.

(camera to Gyouter)

Roig: He will only select few he think can be trusted. Trusted meaning, that they won't tell the Oppositions that leads to takedown.

Gyouter: Wait what are you using?

Roig: GitHub & GitLab.

Gyouter: 💀 No...

Roig: Oh c'mon, I tried searching far & wide. Free storage for all. This only we got. And still the worst idea, especially [GitHub](https://github.com/github/dmca).

(camera to Gyouter)

Roig: There is no other way. This poop, or rent somebody's space, coz guess what? This is not house. It's servers that needs to eat.

Gyouter: This.. I wish I can help you. We'll soon find it.

Roig: Thanks man. ..

(look at file) (interactive look around)

### Back out

Info: After enjoying the inside, it's time for them to go to the Right hallway for the discussion. train on left from the first thick door.

Jallopy: (keep straight) Okay, after the main lab, into this hallway.

(Rattling Rail)

Jallopy: Welcome to the Residential Area. Here not just labs, but also where we live, and other facilities. Discussion rooms too. Meeting Rooms of all sizes with extra toys you desire to unbore you.

Gyouter: Great! I hope there's one we can use.

Roig: We have already placed reservation just for you gamers. I believe you'll need it for further talk after our recent handovers.

Gyouter: Wow! Thank you so much! Okay, great!

Jallopy: If you see the space there, that's our Work in Progress. we're expanding.

Gyouter: Wow! is that gonna be the biggest city underground of Dasandim?

Roig: We're not seeking competition you know? just.. have a big space, and big living, that's it. Zumi thinks the same. Competition in the Warez only benefits sparsdater than the gamers. Very ironic. No money, only empty happiness.

Gyouter: Yikes.. Warez and Nukes. Eugh...

Roig: We don't do that fortunately. Whatever there is, it's here. If better, just complement the better, too many files, screw this.

Gyouter: Yeah.

Jallopy: (stop by this Meeting house) Okay, gamers. Arrive. Your meeting space is ready. Check your belongings

*everyone*: (check belongings)...

Gyouter: (also check)....

Roig: (check belongings)..., (done) (get off to the left) Okay!

*everyone*: (success & get off to left)

Roig: (async) Now that we're here. You have unlimited time. Yeah I mean, this public facility is perks here. It's free. free to use, for just hanging out and bla bla bla, like Gazebo something2.

Gyouter: (async) (get off to the left)... (pay attention to Roig)

Roig: (short pausing) Any question? No? good. So..

Yuruk Bubut: (open door and get out).,... Man!, Simon really needs help!

Pashudok Olaved: (come out) I agree! Simon needs help!

Uziliti Bamye: (come out) We have to rescue Simon. We can't stand seeing him like this!!

*activitsts*: (get on the train)

Yuruk: Wait sir!

Jallopy: Okay.

(everyone look again there is one left)

Gobuyus: (come out drunk)...., (Burp)!! Who the F8888!!, told you to write this f8888888 depressing s8888, Ward?!.. Eee(burp)euh eugh...

Gyouter: (shocked with the `b88888 piece of sh88888`) Euuooo, Language buddy!...

Gobuyus: (to nothing at further expand) whad'y'lookin-at?!...

Gyouter: (head adjust down Y)...?

(everyone back look Gobuyus again)..

Gobuyus: (hop to train).., (sit drunkly hard)!! GOOoo!!..

Jallopy: All aboard!, (run train)....

Roig: 😬 (smile)...... Apologies. We have noticed, recently, abundant influx of use of our meeting rooms. Like this especially, pertaining a couple consisting of Simon Petrikov & Betty, that something went wrong with them and so tragic I heard. I think I heard these names before, but what is it? Anyways.., Uh.. Do you mind if you have to wait to

Gyouter: No thank you, we can do this.

Roig: It's okay. We clean very fast

Gyouter: Don't worry about it. We can handle this.

Roig: Okay, Sure, (open door of them)..... Please if you may.

Gyouter: Right, gamers.

#### Minivault Meeting Room 27 Japanese Home theme

Gyouter: No? ... Well, I have noticed that we have new here, and only few of us original, left. Let me elaborate.

*everyone*: (Pay attention)

Gyouter: We just seen archive place in here. That includes every related assets Kaorfa had downloaded and to be downloaded.

*everyone*: (still pay attention)

Gyouter: Now let me ask this, in actual reveal literal sense. **Do you want these FNF mods to be unignored?**

...

...

Gyouter: As you can see, Kolmorotzzet uses Git to manage each file versionings, and to place them on a host. Mind you once again that X0p1r4t3 encounters difficulty finding worthy place that is permanent buy, because we all know, no permanent buy in cyber world. I wish there is like buy house, ... here we are. Agree or not? Upload these

Fern: What if we got DMCA'd? Will our universe destroy?

Gyouter: Depend on how severe. But let's hope that's not happening at all.

Fern: I believe when we have it, best shot is to have remote that we rent ourselves. the `origin` shall remains `private`, only `this new one` that's `public`. (Realize Kaorfa extremely hates non-permanent purchase of basically) Wait. Rent is bad.

Gyouter: That's right.

Fern: We only have that one this timeline tho..

Gyouter: Yes. ... But economically reckless. If something, that only takes our soul, eventually it's out. And plus, is not as critical as Backblazer, different story. We're talking about stuffs, gamers wished they have, but they don't. To make the mission worth doing, it is best if it costs as less as possible, especially the net cost. gross like Quota, forget it. We want, we need, Server, secure, and Gratis. SO, I'd say we tell Kaorfa. It's been so long, Why data has to be prisoned here?

Fern: Man... I wish...

Gyouter: NO biggy to Linode tho. Perhaps could've been used for something else idk what. We have to find the best, efficient, and gratis. As well as free from threats of DMCA, by renting a house from Linode, no no, not sponsor..., by renting house.. any residence possible, we may have our house and it's our rule (as long as we give them rent). I mean we're not crypto scamming gamers, right? It's just.. a file! bunch of files. idk...........

*everyone*: (contemplating about whether should or not)

Gyouter: Think about it. There is no such thing such as permanent buy public server, it can only be done in Kaorfa's home which compromises security and bandwidth. There is only few Free server that obeys Earth's DMCA. Heck maybe there is one that claims to be *"lesser DMCA"*, but extra caveats that the admin can sus themselves if we're onto big filing something. What do you know? No place. NO home. Keep doing normal under risk, or wait? if wait, file gone.

*everyone*: ([there's nothing we can do](https://youtu.be/b_fHC2TT4xY?si=sDadg6yDg59nw0hH))

#### Out of Meeting room

Gyouter: (open door)...

Info: Roig also hear the meeting from outside while guarding them

Roig: Wait... Then Yes or No? No answer? just it?

Gyouter: (stop & sigh) .... (swing head). . . ...., Kaorfa will decide. (continue leave with immense concern & peturb)... (wait from tram)

Jallopy: (slowing down from his left lane).....

Gyouter: Actually, you should just submit the request.

Roig: Okeh!..

Gyouter: I mean it's too long already. At least we put credit in the `link.txt`, have you made sure?

Roig: Yes, we always put sauce URL in those lists as we downloaded them.

Gyouter: Great. Now if you excuse me, gamers?

*everyone*: (hop onto the train)!!

Gyouter: I'll see you later. Great luck, God Bless you.

Roig: GBU too. Great luck. (wave hand lazily)...

Jallopy: All aboard! (run accelerate tram)!.......

Roig: .... (sigh) Haaah..... well... It's now. (go to office & submit request to Joel)
