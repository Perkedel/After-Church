# stamped as terrorist

We are gathered here for this urgent meeting regarding relationship between us Earthling & Dasandimian.

...

You people stamped everyone of us as a terrorist. Guess you finally got yourself one. No, that's true, no offense. For the record, your people have canceled over 1 Trillion talents around the world. 75% of them were forced to retire upon these events. Don't you dare expect them to be "*strong & tough*", **BULLSHIT!!** Bullying is bullying. You've destroyed their mentality on purpose. You bastard.

Thought we could trust you for times to come but apparently, the level of toxicity increases every time comes. What did you do with those prisoners? You freed them without educating any?!

From now on, effective immediately upon this hearing at 20xx-xx-xx, planet Earth is no longer permitted to interact, trade, and otherwise assimilate with us Dasandimian. This decision is considered absolute and shall not be revoked by any mean. 

Any people that has Dasandimian nationality are ordered to evacuate maximum 3 year upon this hearing. Dasandim will additionally close registration and prohibit any nationality registration upon this grace time aforementioned. Any Dasandimian that after this grace time still not leaving Earth will be considered deserting and their nationality will be suspended permanently without any ways to resolve available.
