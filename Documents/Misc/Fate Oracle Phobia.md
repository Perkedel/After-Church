# Fate Oracle Phobia

No, not Oracle Java, the... prediction, yess!!

Family guy inspired gag moments

Inspired from True story. My mom afraid to try oracle on one mall famous for it. If result is bad, you would stressed & will kept thinking about it everyday.

## Begin

Ido Alamus: No, no oracle. If the master says I got bad fate, I would not be able to cease thinking about it for good.

Lizz Yudhoyono: (traktired the peramal) I got it. Says you'll have financial struggle on the next October this year.

Ido: (angry faic)?!?!?!?!..... YOU MOTHERF8888AAAAAAA!!!!
