# Regenerate hands but still lose

This Jedi can regenerate just chopped off hands and every limbs. But still lose battle anyways. How?!

Family Guy inspired moments. Star Wars moments.

## Begin

### Somekind of power silo

(lightsaber battle. Jerosh Guramgab vs. Orykuk)..

Jerosh Guramgab: (counter)!!

Orykuk: (slide off the counter)!!

Jerosh: HEUH!!, (try slash abdomen) HYA!!

Orykuk: (counter)!!.... (push off upward)!!!

Jerosh: (losing balance, rebalancing) OUOH!..

Orykuk: (chop both hands)!!

Jerosh: (both hands chooped off) OAAAAAA!!!

(Hands & light saber fell from height to the bottom)..

Jerosh: SSssss... OOOGH...

Orykuk: HAH!!! No hand! I win!!!

Jerosh: SSS.. Uugh.. Is that all you got?! (both forearms extend to front towards) Watch!. (regrow hands)!!!!........... (meat complete)....... (skin & details completed) Ah!! Hahaaa!! (Force his lightsaber back to right hand)!.....

(lightsaber floats back up)!...

Jerosh: (caught lightsaber)!, (draw & turn on again)!!

Orykuk: You fool! (right hand off lightsaber to left hand, right hand hold his mind command the drone in the bottom & open portal for the drone)....

> Wait, why has to be through this? This is Hollywood cliche!

I get it. But hear me out, it still make sense.

He could've gone with ATM, but remember, AI is getting smarter & get skeptical especially when account holder appears wanted to take entire cash out.  
Now here in manual teller, is easily exploitable, because everything at normal scenario would be seen by the teller manually & the consenting owner. & since the teller had no power, the teller unfortunately had to let robbery happen or he die choked.  
Okay, just break the machine with Force? Nuh uh. not only it rings, but the machine can also attack! Its theft spray liquid has microchip that constantly broadcast signal 2 galaxies away up to 500 millenium non-stop, and is unerasable by all means.  
So no. Only manual robbery make the safest. And fun fact, Orykuk is lucky, because when banks are phasing out manual teller, this bank happen to haven't yet joined ATM only wagon.  
Why still manual teller?! the CEO is stupid and has low IQ, saying that people lacks knowledge of technology without ever popping something about security exploits that banks already thought years ago. And boy, look at 500s of these bank companies, they're all idiots! rest of the banks accross galaxies already removed manuall teller, and even recently started up anew bank company is exclusively App & ATM no cash only.
