## Trugmak planet. Posole hill.
Sky: (arrived through portal from her home)...

Zogteney: Alright, another one.. Oh yess! IONIQ 5! they've arrived!

Retoreney: (call `attention pls`) 👏👏!,  Everyone!!

Sky: (park & get out from car).

Latsufir Umnaga: (get out from car).

Zogteney: Hi. Welcome to Trugmak. Our event will be straight over there. see that big stadium there? That's where we going, in 10 hours. You must be.. Sky aand Latsufir.

Latsufir: Yess. Latsufir Umnaga, (soft soup hand point to Sky) Sky. Just Sky.

Zogteney: Zogteney. Nice to meet you. So, you were called here, because you own one of the most hyped alt EV in the galaxies. Guess what, it's Hyundai IONIQ 5. Earth people, especially Indonesian are very excited with this car.

Sky: Oh yess! IONIQ 5 looks like the best so far.

Latsufir: But I have a question, why us?

Zogteney: Because I heard you modified your IONIQ 5 so that it had all of the features no IONIQ 5 itteration on Earth has. It was only you, who took the time to frankenstein all that misses.

Latsufir: 😄 Ahaa, yess..

Sky: This car we imported from Earth, specifically Indonesia. Yess, the Indonesian version because it's cheap & also to pay respect for the.. forget about it.

Zogteney: Oh don't be shy. People has hype here and that's normal.

Sky: mmm okay. Yeah, so it has lost alot of the features. We added everything except the wheel drives & the keyfob. that's too risky.

Zogteney: Alright I see.

Sky: It's just a prototype after all. We'll change the car revision later.

Zogteney: Hu uh hu uh.. Right. That doesn't matter right now, we'll see its development soon. For now, you will need to help us abolish the monopoly here we suffered from. You see those Konslag cars that have been passing all this time?

Sky: Huh. Never heard of.

Zogteney: It's this government's brand. life's only viable with that car. But it had paywalls, worse than Tesla is. Serveral infotainment features such as apps are cloud only, and is subscription. Other brands made suffer, only Konslag are allowed to charge & idle for $0. While other brands must pay $100 a Kilowatt hour, idle fees are $50 a minute, not hour. litteral minutes. Whatever it is.

Sky: Huh.. That's...

Zogteney: That's why, we need your help. We tried before, but guards kept getting rid of us and gave us threat. a deadly threat. we're hopeless. You're the only hope. You also need to speak English at least with proper accent, specifically general American about 30% of nativeness.

Sky: Okay.

Zogteney: Now, the travel to the stadium is very far. That IONIQ 5 is not gonna cut it just by once 100%. No, it can't. not even ECO can help. Therefore you need to atleast about 1 charger from here. But remember again, there's a catch. You need to pay intitial fee of $10. not US Dollar, Trugmak Dollar. Aand you used other brand, so you need to exchange about... wait what's Dasandim *Dollar*?

Retoreney: It's Kivrontz, sir. And it's cryptocurrency.

Zogteney: Ah yess. you gotta difficulty, *children*. Trugmak hates crypto. Crypto exchange has been banned. and even centralized bank of Kiblonz (paper cash version of Dasandim money), banned because Dasandim already loves crypto. But don't worry, we have the solution.

Sky: 😀 Oh! what is it?

Zogteney: We summon the charging god. no I mean, small letter `g` in god, not the main God we worship, no. special *sub-god*, helpful angel, purposed to fulfill EV charging convenience. She's called `PoweRaid`. Why female? don't ask. Kaorfa (JOELwindows7) is a man of culture, so that's the answer.

Sky: 🤣!!

JOELwindows7: Disclaimer. the *sub-god* is for this cinematic universe only. idk how do I supposed to call specific helpful purpose deity, pls help! I'm sorry God, I don't mean to do any something bad here. Okay, perhaps I just call them angel again instead, idk. I'll think about this later. Ah damn it, let's call angel instead.

Zogteney: Anyway, if you are in a situation where EV charging becomes hostile or non-existent, you call her. I'll teach you now.

Sky: Okay. ready.

Zogteney: You raise your right hand, like this (raising the torch to sky gesture)! Like holding torch or I say charging connector, lift it up to sky *YEAAAH!!!*.. like that.

Sky: ... (repeat gesture) *YEAAAH!*

Zogteney: Good! good, that's great. Raight.. without the *YEAH*, like lift it up like that aand.. shout this.. (in Bahasa Indonesia)

> PoweRaid, Datanglah!!! (Da..tanglah!!!)

(a green hologramic above Zogteney's hand shaped of CCS Type 2 flashes once)

Zogteney: Laiik that. Now.

Sky: 🤨 uh... PoweRaid... Dhateungluuh..

(red CCS Type 2 holographic flash means failed, invalid)

Zogteney: Oh, sorry. You can't speak Bahasa Indonesia yet?

Sky: I'm still learning..

Zogteney: That's alright, don't worry. PoweRaid can accept multiple languages. so.. (repeat gesture)..

> PoweRaid, I summon you!!! (I.. summonyou!!!)

(same green CCS Type 2 holographic flash)!!

Sky: (repeat gesture), PoweRaid, I summon you!!!

(finally green CCS Type 2 flash yey)

Zogteney: WOW!!! You learned fast! Amazing! So, that's how you do it. Simple! She will open the clouds, reel down the cable, and plug it right your car. YESS!! Also remember, PoweRaid loves Bahasa Indonesia, so it's best if you learn more that.

Sky: Oh okay, I'll keep learning. But btw, why it doesn't happen now?

Zogteney: Great question! That's because, we are in the **Cause** zone. here, are where all EV owners unite fighting monopoly by our government. And this area here has been assigned by PoweRaid herself. So you can see, charging here.. are $0. all cars.

Sky: Wow. thancc so much!

Zogteney: No problem. and hey, you have nice Dasandimian English accent, that's great!

Sky: 😂 ahahaaa yess. I just learned that from Latsufir. So that's how Dasandimian speak.

Zogteney: Yeah. Dasandimian English accent are surreal memes speak you can see.

Sky: Oh.. meme man?

Zogteney: Correct!

Sky: woow...

Latsufir: I have a question. I wonder if there's a polution (Internal Combustible Engine gasoline) version of this.

Zogteney: Oh that umm.. Great question! There is one.

Latsufir: Oh, really?!

Zogteney: Yep. Gaseline, she called. I know, 😂 funny convenient play of words, but that's her name. In fact she's just PoweRaid's twin sister.. I mean *evil twin* I suppose. And she lives in Hell instead of Heaven.

Latsufir: Oh, okeh. therefore if you..

Zogteney: want to call her, instead torch up, you torch down. shout `Gaseline, I summon you!!!` remember, Gaseline not PoweRaid.., and the hellgate cracks open from the ground. don't worry, its collider still tangible, the gas hose come up, opens up your gas cover & twist open the second cap, and she put that hose in (`mmmfh 😏` of arousal emotion canceled due to that it's gasoline and ew). Yeah.

Latsufir: Okay. Not so different, just the position.

Zogteney: Yep, exactly.

Latsufir: Now.. ever you seen any of them, in person?

Zognteney: No, never yet. I wish I do. You too right? please don't

Latsufir: (felt little bit triggered) Uh.. 🤨 excuse me?

Zogteney: SOrry, I mean. You don't see them (do not ever attempt to appoint meeting PoweRaid nor Gaseline in person). Never, especially you already had girfriend over there. Is she jealousy?

Latsufir: Yes, [she is](https://gamebanana.com/mods/44555 ). She hates to see man, who is me would go with another girl. Of course!

Zogteney: Yeah so if you had to meet either or both of them, you hug your Sky while holding her cups from back whenever you greet these 2. I trained it myself with my wife, that eases her. Should work with yours.

Latsufir: Okay, thancc for your info. I mean, what's going on with their look?

Zogteney: Yess. People say (konon, katanya), PoweRaid & Gaseline are (bean dani is it just me or is it look kinda thicc bass boost impact) ***THICC***!!! You know thicc right?

Latsufir: Yess. okeh, go on.

Zogteney: their cups are pecking plush! girls down there be mad. Oh man, just imagine PoweRaid & Gaseline gone fight for little male playing. just like.. child scramble for the only toy. hah.. 😏😏😏😏😏 that's painful.

Latsufir: Okay.

Zogteney: Just be careful. It'll be very awkward, so only have either of them to such emergency occasion. okeh?

Latsufir: Okekeh.

Zogteney: Now, (give paper of map to stadium) here I have location for you. But basically, you go dead straight, (point to pink road) from that pink pathway there. easy!

Latsufir: Okay.

Zogteney: Right, so.. you gotta go now.

Latsufir: Oh, now?

Zogteney: The event start tomorrow. Sky?

Sky: Yeah?

Zogteney: Hey, I gave (point to this) Latsufir here the map to stadium. But basically you just go straight, teruuuuuuuuus sampai (gooooooooo until) the barricade.

Sky: I see. mmm maybe Cruise Control will help.

Zogteney: Yeah use that! that straight is very boring and makes you very sleepy. the charger is in between, left side. Oh yeah, like Dasandim, you drive on left.

Sky: Okay.

Zogteney: You gotta go now. The event only runs once every 10 years. don't screw this up pls. We must be free.

Latsufir: Definitely sir. Sky? (get in the car, left passenger front)

Sky: Right, do you have communication?

Zogteney: I can't. the government has been cracking down the Cause. If I send you my communication event with [Librephone level of impossible encryption](https://puri.sm/ ), they'll know anyway. idk how the peck is that is even possible. So you will no longer see us anymore after this until this success.

Sky: Ouch...

Zogteney: Great luck, God Bless you.

Sky: I promise. Great luck GBU too. (get in car, right driver front, & go now)!! ......

Retoreney: 🙋‍♂️🙋‍♂️🙋‍♂️🙋‍♂️🙋‍♂️(wave goodbye fast high torque) GREAT LUCK!!!, GOD BLESS YOU!!!

## Pink Street
Sky: (activate smart sense cruise control)! ... (observe road).

...

...

(serveral Kilometers later, when battery running out)

(cluster & infotainment appear warning low bottom battery)

Sky: Okay.. charger.. (look left)... (found charging station) Yess! (turn left into the station).. (go to slots on left, at middle vaccant), Right.. oh wait. I don't have autopark, 😂 hahaha, 😞 haa.. Okay.. (attempt parking manually)... I can do this.. ... ... (did it) Hah! (left turn signal to see left surround camera).. okay, (right turn signal to see right surround camera)... Okeh, not bad. whatever.

JOELwindows7: Sky, you nailed the serial parking 1st time!!! impressive!

Sky: (get out of car, to back & grab one CCS Type 2 connector), (observe display) hmmm... (press open right fuel I mean charging cap), (about to plug that in but) wait. (fear of violation due inability to pay) don't yet. uh.. (go back to display & view checkout).. Ah man! it's now expensive!

Latsufir: What?

Sky: IONIQ 5 pays $300 initial fee!

Latsufir: AW MAN!! Okay. I think this is your opportunity.

Sky: Right. here we go. (breath in through nose).... (right hand torch up)!, ... PoweRaid, I summon you!!!

(CCS Type 2 green holographic flash above Sky's torch up hand)

Elektronika (a.k.a. PoweRaid): (open cloud portal)! (pulley down the CCS Type 2 charging cable).... (remotely robot hand bend the cable end), (push the fuel cap button), (plug in)!

(IONIQ 5 is now charging at maximum capable Kilowatt)!!

Sky: Thancc, PoweRaid! ahhh.. (go back in the drive seat).. (sitt)! (relacc mode).

(skip straight to 100%)

(beep 100%)

Sky: (awake)! huh? Oh! (look back)

Elektronika: (unplug charger), (push the connector to the fuel cap close button)!, (relax cable & reel up)!!

Sky: Wow. much more convenient.

(thunder storm)!!!

Sky: Huh?

Latsufir: (awake) Heuh?.... uh..

Zieousto: (open bigger cloud portal)... (descend to it)... We've noticed somebody have summoned PoweRaid. (camera zoom menacing to his face) There must be, .... **Monopoly**. (camera 1st person of him) (scan around)... (found a branded proprietary EV charging plug) Konslag!! We knew it. 😠😠😠 (& altitude up a bit) This is unacceptable! (encapsulate the DC charger box & charge plug stand)!! 

Sky: (see those gold barrier just summoned)

Zieousto: (overheat the encapsulated area)!!.........

(duar) 💥💥💥💥💥💥💥💥💥💥💥💥💥💥💥 (but the pieces still trapped inside the encapsulation so it's safe)

Sky: AA!

Zieousto: (magically install brand new all brand free charger systems).... Much better, (unspawn encapsulation). (looked at IONIQ 5).. Hey! Sky!

Sky: what, me?

Zieousto: I need to talk. Stay inside, close window. Latsufir?

Latsufir: Yeah?

Zieousto: (keep mouth shut & use telepathy) You 2 listen closely. I just wanna tell, PoweRaid original name is Elektronika.

Latsufir: (telepathy) Oh, okay.

Zieousto: No wait! not today. keep using PoweRaid. Jegulo the evil president is cracking down Elektronika name. He will arrest anyone calling her name.

Sky: I see. Elektronika. stay with PoweRaid for now. Okeh.

Zieousto: Great luck, God Bless you. (ascend back to Heaven)!!

Sky: ... Right, let's go.

(run again)

Sky: (drive manually).... (finally arrive at stadium with barricade blocking pink path to redirect to stadium entry point) Ah finally, (turn right to get into stadium)..

Qefel: Yeah..

Latsufir: Ah damn. Sky!

Zogteney: Thank you. 😭.. (sniff)!!!

Latsufir: No problem man. glad we can help.

Retoreney: It's been 20 decades, we've been living like this. We people are fighting. everytime who are against that guy, receives heavy lot punishments. I cannot bear to see those punishments are like. I've had ever seen it even.

Sky: Well, it's over now. You can move and rebuild the world.

Zogteney: Yeah. (release hug slowly).

Retoreney: Now. What gift can we give for you, people? Sorry, we don't have money right now.

Latsufir: Actually we don't need money right now. We already have alot. I work for my government.

Retoreney: Ah yess, of course. Is that an Indonesia Cikarang version of IONIQ 5? I can sense its aura there.

Latsufir: Oh wow, you can scan aura?

Retoreney: Yess. My borhter Zogeney is telekinetic & I am aura seer. And it looks like you forgot to add the front motor.

Sky: Yess, it's too risky.

Retoreney: The keyfob too. it doesn't have remote parking assist & bell horn button.

Latsufir: Correct!

Retoreney: Well, that's easy. we frankenstein alot of EV in my life, so I'll take time to learn this new car. Got workshop in your place?

Latsufir: We have, called Import Yoink Alliance. This state company imports stuffs & frankenstain stuffs.

Retoreney: Cool! we can collaborate.

Latsufir: Absolutely! if you want to know the location, it's here.. (send info card wirelessly)

Retoreney: (received).... ah yess, that! Right. So, we're done?

Zogteney: I think so.

Retoreney: Right, here my card (send info card wirelessly), if you have anything you can contact us.

Latsufir: Alright, thancc. so.

Zogteney: Great lick, God Bless you!!!

(everyone cheer great luck GBU)!!!!

Latsufir: Okay, excuse me..

(move away from to be deployed portal hole at front of IONIQ 5)

Sky: (open portal to home)!
