Why the peck you even need a framework to make video game

you see

before I make game with a framework

everything is jumble and mess up

they're not consistent with each other

I want you to standardize things so you can reuse that later

and sometimes it's really hard to make them again

therefore you need people to work for you, you can't work yourself

and therefore you can create whole set of standards that will be usable later

reusable, easy to use, 

and best of all.. uhhh what is it?

you can add or decrease feature for specific need yay

hope that helps 👍
