# Uh oh!
Somebody did an oopsie. Having balls to dare building **Non Fungible Token (turd)** games **is a giant no no in Dasandim!, not to mention many galaxies.** Not only the environment will suffer, the money will also turns into zombies! You can have the bits in your wallet, but you never hold it real. It is not merit when things that meant to be copied, artificially limited in amount.

As always, Right click, save as folks!

Hamund Jacobson: You cannot do this to me! I thought you guys supports Crypto fully.

Kombi Fenior: (handcuffing & tying up the suspect, with suspect hands on back) That's for our currency. But what you did is make things that meant to be copied, artificially limited. Afterall, what's the point of those bytes, huh? why you join pricing bytes, making bytes too expensive like nobody but stupider than common idiots? (async) (finished tying, slap left shoulder)!! We're gonna get you lawyer. And you gotta explain this to judges you know.

Hamund: (async) OW man!!! What the f888?! ....... ...... ... .....

Kombi: Don't say `what the f888` you gold digging wh888! You're going to scam our people into paying useless bits that priced exorbitantly while giving nothing in return but a stupidest than idiots of fame. Nawh!! get to the car.

Hamund: Kayy, Jesus christ, Holy sh88. (walk to police car)

Kombi: Watch your mouth, buddy! Avoid using God's name in your vain.

Sky: Ah... okey, where were we?

Latsufir: We were in the.... Economic environment show.. Yess.

Sky: Okay. I missed the show. We fell asleep.

Dotmun: Yeah. we have collected all the replay. You were bored extremely high over those boring podcast talks. And when you both finally asleep, that's when they reveal their true intention.

Sky: Haah?!

Dotmun: Alright, I have the file in my mind.

Latsufir: (ask Dotmun hold hand together with left hand) Okay, give it to us.

Dotmun: Okay (hold Latsufir's left hand with right hand), (ask Sky's hand) Sky?

Kombi: (seized Hamund & tie handcuff him) Gotcha, you scammer. 

Hamund: uuuhhh

## Video finished.
Dotmun: I know, this is very boring here. But I already send you my mind, remind it anytime aand, we got more perspective around here if you want. Basically, Hamund created podcast talks. First he used your car as a showcase, show what features, followed by long boring podcast talk, from 6 different entrepreneurs that makes regular things, and after that, it's NFT showtime. It's intentional. so you got bored, fall asleep, unable to report about this.

Latsufir: The hell??

Dotmun: I know. You've been trapped, bamboozled, scammed. Thinking that it was your mission. We were wrong. We've been betrayed.

Latsufir: You people tell me what intention originally was, lemme check (check assignment parameter), coz anything I just do it.

Dotmun: Gyouter says it was for bringing exciting ways to play video games through crypto integration or something. Heck he even lied that it won't be an NFT. The Kivrontz isn't even being mentioned. From what I understand it's all about using your ID card to store game save. Nothing special.

Latsufir: (confirmed the mission parameter) Uh huh. And we are called here, to *help attract Hamund's fans in his spectacular show*. No detail. Make sense, he wants to give surprise and no spoiler. üò¨ I don't know..

Dotmun: Don't blame yourself. We really did not know.

Gyouter Embinosa: (enter scene from teleport portal) Okay. Is everything okay & solved?

Latsufir: (look at Gyouter)..

Gyouter: (worried & walk towards) Lats? Sky? Oh my God. I pecking didn't expect this. I pecking sorry, people. What the hell!..

Latsufir: It's alright, we did not know this.

Gyouter: Oh man. I am so stupid! I should've had interviewed him even more! That dream item incentives keeps me from being sus!

Latsufir: What do you expect?

Gyouter: Unlimited game passes from all galaxies & forever claim paid games for $0 entire lifespan inheritable.

Latsufir: Okay, that one is never been so it's hard.

Gyouter: Heh üò† yeah. He's pecking clever. Trying to slip through world of NFTs to Dasandim. Knew that we hate NFTs, then he uses complicated terms & overly bogus claims so to make us all confused, bored, fall asleep, but only know **yes** and **yes**.

Latsufir: Got an idea. If he talks too much, reject him. Beg anyone to straight to the point. bet they lost their mind, as they have to simply say, for NFTs.

Gyouter: Ah! Genius.

Kombi: Put your hands in the (knocked) uoh!!

Jocksi (cryptobros, background audience): (escaping) Not for me!

Dotmun: (fire stun lobber)!!

Jocksi: ‚ö°HUAH!!.......!!!!!!!!!!!, (passout fell)!!

Kombi: (run towards) Don't you dare try running from us, the punishment more severe every metres.. (handcuff tied Jocksi)!!... (tie up)!!, (lift up forcefully) Let's go. (slap back)!! (escort)

Jocksi: üò°...

Redonek: (confirmed the audience count) Okay, looks like that's the last one. We're done all! (open door),

Kombi: Get (throw Jocksi) inside!

Jocksi: Ugh!

Redonek: (immediately slam door & lock)!! People?

Kombi: get back to van

Dotmun: Okay, See you later. We got all of them. Great luck, God Bless you.

Gyouter: Great luck GBU (pat)! ! too.

Dotmun: Jump jack?

Jack: Yeah, wait wait.. (tidying up)... Okay! (go back to van)

Dotmun: Alright?

Gyouter: okay.

Dotmun: (go back to van)

(all back), (depart to police department)...

# The Next Day, Ft. Hypocrisies
## Wakturia. Mission Command Centre. Evening 6 PM
Gyouter: (sitting in front stage chair & desk)....

Ponguat Sutul: (enter Mission Command Centre).., Yes?

Opem Ferasol: (async) (follow get in)

Tirr Miteg: (async) (follow get in)

Gyouter: (async) Okay. you people have come. You were called here for the urgent meeting regarding to the car we've just imported couple weeks ago. It was the Hyundai IONIQ 5, Sky had chosen.

Ponguat: Okay, what's wrong here?

Gyouter: Malore?

Nubir Fongyeul: Dude, where was it?

Malore Konufir: Alright. (send [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5xRYHf_LeI ), [this special Twitter](https://twitter.com/Hyundai_NFT ), and just show the [Discord invite link](https://discord.com/invite/hyundai-nft  ), to the big screen front stage)... Kay, look.

Ponguat: Okay (look up to big stage).. (examine) what the??

Gyouter: (rotate away from desk & lean on desk in disappointment)....

Opem: Oh my God, what is that??

Tirr: Man, I need to protocol.. (pinch self)... Egh!! NO no no no.. It can't be!

Ponguat: üò®....

Gyouter: Right. I just wanna.. wanna let you know. That uh.. That's one of the collab they did.

Ponguat: (hands crush hair) Ooooowh, Go..d, Not this one.... Oh my God.. (sitt on floor)!!!..

Gyouter: Now, for this matter, we have no idea yet whether should we have Lats & Sky know.. or maybe wait, not too long... umm suggest..

Latsufir: (suddenly enter command centre) What's going on in here?

Gyouter: WHAAAA (show desktop)!! oH! Oh Hi. Latsufir.

Latsufir: I felt you stressed. What's going on in here?

Ponguat: (look towards each other in worried) Uhh..

Gyouter: Okay, We will explain.

Sky: (casually enter too)..

Gyouter: OH NO, SKY.. Ah. okay. Don't panik. This is usual. Latsufir is a very curious guy. He can feel if there's something wrong, he is very care. Just so you remember. AAnnhd..

Ponguat: (stop panik), (look towards each other), (nod each other).

Gyouter: Time to tell the truth. (restore all windows).

Latsufir: (look up & examine)... (pupil dilate)!?!??!?!??!

Gyouter: I know. I know. This..

Latsufir: (step closer & upset).... üò†ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è?!?! Hey.

Gyouter: I don't know.

Latsufir: ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è....

Gyouter: Alright so uh.. We have 2 options. I hope you chose the 1st. One, keep the car but of course not denying anything, run it like normal nothing happed.., Two, you can hand it over to us so we can *dispatch* your car.

JOELwindows7: **Dispatch**. terms coined by [Shawn Woods (Mousetrap Monday)](https://www.youtube.com/c/ShawnWoodsprimitive-archer ), to safely slaughter trapped animals specifically non-native & invasive species. e.g. Safely ***dispatch*** mouse since this mouse is non-native & is invasive.

Latsufir: Uh... I wish I can choose one. I can choose 2, but yeah. We just got it new, aand we were in the moment of excitement for electrification in here, and uh.. We just got it. mch! üò¨sssss (vacuum), (blow air out of nose)..., Keep it (choose 1). Sky?

Sky: uh... I like the car. One.

Gyouter: That's alright.

Latsufir: I think I remember somebody once said,

Gyouter: *Many people we know & love have fallen into such a scam. Perhaps it is the time for us to CEASE destroying their reputation just because they went into it*. Yes. It was Kaorfa.

Latsufir: that's why I chose number one. Imagine we did two for everything. I bet we would've become.. no difference than toxic & unforgiveful person ever be, like Japan, idk.

Gyouter: We would eventually downgrade to caves & scratches.

Latsufir: (sit on the stage stair)

Gyouter: I know, this is complicated. ... üò¨ssss, Ah whadoi say? Dispatch, if you change your mind, uh feel free anytime, I guess. We'll think about it. We only know how to dispatch animals. non-living things? never been.

Nubir: I think it goes like this. disassemble thing,

Malore: fry all the components!

Nubir: Uh uh.. bury them in cement, send them to Earth where they come from, make it statue of shame.

Gyouter: Okay, noted.

Malore: Everybody know this?

Gyouter: Not yet. it's just between us. But I bet everyone eventually knows later, and it's quick for things like this.

## Tokson house, Texcity
Tokson Mural (dad): (saw the collab video) Oh my God. mama??!!

Ziatron Ufaira: Yess daddy?

Tokson: Not fetish this time. Did we pre-ordered Hyundai IONIQ 5?

Ziatron: Um yess.

Tokson: Okay, thancc. I guess I was too fast judging here.

## Go back to command centre.
Ponguat: Sir. Just now, we have received tremendous amounts of cancelation & pre-order refunds. all of them are Hyundai's.

Opem: (also looked) all of them are IONIQ 5. all canceled. People cancel have car.

Tirr: We did not engage the import yet though, whew I guess?

Ponguat: You have 1 car which is for the demo couple weeks ago.

Gyouter: Right, I am not sure if that one really gonna be dispatched. I have to think. I need space. Meanwhile.. I know this is crazy, insane, lunatic. Dasan's EV. I know,

Ponguat: ..It's not confirmed yet, never been tested yet by test firms around galaxies, and Dasan is still improving it to this day.

Gyouter: I mean, it's been 50 years. By the looks of it last time, it's appropriate. Remember, This car is self repairable & self upgradeable yess!

Opem: Yeah. But yeah, uh.. gotta be complicated, we haven't thought yet the manufacturing lines. It has to be built en masse first. We have alot of Dasandimians here now, pure, come from, everything. way too lot.

Gyouter: (fall head to desk)..

Tirr: If we may, we can consider rolls royce it, special for Latsufir & Sky. To be as well direct evaluation for it.

Ponguat: But I'm afraid, you see, last time I visited, the build is uh dynamic. not dedicated, not baked. Car designs on road are already baked, no change needed or possible. This one, means it's prototype & it can have loose screws.

Tirr: I know, but what if in case?

Ponguat: Yeah we gotta prepare for either situations. aand ahh..

## Tokson house again
Tokson: (realize something else).... On second thought, if I think about this. Maybe I am *Japan*. Who never forgive just for one mistake or what. I can't afford be like that. I am not Toxic.

Ziatron: You changed your mind?

Tokson: Hu uh. I am not Japan. I am forgiveful. I hope I don't got hypnotized by NFTs, in the name of Lord Jesus, (reorder again)!

JOELwindows7: Sorry for racism! but it's [true](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwsE7Np50sk ) (Rushia is now Mikeneko, play Genshin, another user suspect trade with `Neko` thought it was Mikeneko, I guess it's wrong, but this genshin user tweeted out, tagged mikeneko. considering her trauma, she went outright angery thinking harrasment happened again, call out idk pls help, I mean this user likes to make drama against Mikeneko while she was just trying to be happy, idk. Basically, wants it titanic or samurai or ninja, Japanese people are generally unforgiveful and got **huuuuuge roots of bitterness**, 9999999 times bigger than me and some others. One reputation collapse, bam! you must find way to reincarnate, idk, don't. All this for culture of shame poops like that, and people expect others to do & comply so, **SO PECKING MUCH** while refusing to understand why should be there a tolerance case by case basis. okay edit. I'm really sorry, I am not going to forget the fact Japan has semimasen. look, immature people do exist, doesn't matter the spec but also doesn't mean well mannered people absent, idk man. just saying.). I'll make everyone stop saying `Japan`. say `Unforgiveful` instead. I'll try my best though, since this truth discovery is relatively receont, it's rather difficult.

## Back again.
Ponguat: Uo! Well uh.. just got pre-orders back again. Okay.

Gyouter: Alright, that's all for today. No idea what to do here for now. Dismiss. Great luck, God Bless you.

Latsufir: üòë...
