# Crash tree hitman

Your target is this hopeless guy. He was drunk driving. And when he skids, he always miss the tree, unless you are the tree.

The target did grave crime and got exposed. The target had successfully accomplished his crime though.

Tips:
- Huntress Wizard. Become tree at the trajectory the drunk guy would went. Definitely Accident elimination
- target is not afraid to gun being pointed at, he even wants to be shot dead. "Why wait? Go ahead, shoot me."
- there is no police tracking. You will have 99,99% chance of Silent Assassin no matter what. The passerby would not even want to stop to see.

Extra:
- The target has free roaming ghost ability, which mean killing him is worse idea than prisoning him alive. He can reincarnate or continue to massacre more victims
