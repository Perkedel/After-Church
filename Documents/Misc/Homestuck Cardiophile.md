# Nepeta becomes Cardiophilia

We of course gave everyone a stethoscope included in the `Welcome to the Perkedel Cinematic Universe` pack, coz of course, **we like heartbeat**.

Cutaway Family Guy Inspired moment

JOELwindows7: Ahei, gamers. Do you really think we forgot our true root here in Perkedel Cinematic Universe? Watch.

## Begin

Nepeta Leijon: `:33` ⬅️ (enter her room).... (saw a gift) **OwO**, what's this?? (take & examine), (take close look) hmmm..., `For: Nepeta`, `from: Kaorfa`. Hah. Joel?? eeh okay, (unwrap tear it)....., heh? whaat?? weird, `Littmann`.. (further unbox), (saw a paper fell, take a look first)?? (take paper), (read & follow)..

> How to Use (pictogram of):
>
> - Attach both metallic earpieces with rubber on the tip to your ear hole as shown.
> - Test by tap the big drum on the other end (that weird shapped spool yess) little slow, to ensure the mode is correct. Careful! it's very loud!
> - If it's not loud, twist the drum neck, until it snaps to another position. Test again. Otherwise skip this step. **We are going to use the bigger drum**, not the smaller ones. Make sure that drum when you tap is loud.
> - Ready to use! Steth someone or yourself. (as shown) stick the big drum to your or someone's chest bit to the left, assuming default spec. You should hear a strange double drumming inside your chest. that's your 💓 heartbeat. It's because you got heart valve, and every open & closing colission will have this noise.

Nepeta: `:33` ⬅️ (equip).., (test mode)! ! (pain loud) AAGH!!, (read again), ... (skip), (hold stethpiece like shown)... (steth her own chest), (Trancends just like this [meme](https://youtu.be/knGhzlGsGtk )) 😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮.........
