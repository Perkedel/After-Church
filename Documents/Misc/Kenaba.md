These group of people including host did mass party hdhehdjdhdjdjdj that time. Now they sober up and realize they are screwed up.

Tryna build reputation other identity or not but exposed and get hated anyways.

Who should be blamed? The group, or the host? The host did drunk all members and hypnotized them.  
Something that mass potato is itself already suspicious, why would so many do that? Someone gotta wake them up before they did unforgivable horrible act. There is none, all drunk. They can't even hear those victims screaming inside, coz these were also anasthesized. These victims grows as a monster that no longer stopable.
They cannot have life. No foster own descendant, no business, no close family, no nothing. Spouse or any guardian replace foster, in fear they had horrible left. Nothing, zero, other than *immediately move realm*.

Who will have the miracle? No, who will manage to make & test that the miracle works?
Who could tame the monsters? Who could restore lives of the uninnocents? Who could tell these two fires, they've been played around by one host?

These days lots of accusation, all wrong, no longer 1 right.

# a miracle manifests

Once upon a time, Son and dad do DNA test to make Dasandim ID account. The son and dad DNA mismatch, so they cannot link dad's DNA to Son's new account. Dad is not son's dad. Somebody else. Dad's worry finally got cracked anyways, and now he got to complete the truth. Son & mom are actually adopted from black market, as a samaritan feelings. Who son is come from?

Dasandim found the DNA, it was from a criminal. He is not moved realm himself yet. And *by himself* indeed, he was one of the drunk member. It has been concluded, the father image will be permanently broken as a consequences from those victimized monster accusators. The descendant will not have either or both real parents. Devastating side effect.

Dasandim Sorrow City to reset reputations and crackdown the host that did this.
