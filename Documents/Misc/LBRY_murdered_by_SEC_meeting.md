# LBRY Murdered

This is record of the broadcasted meeting discussing the murder of LBRY inc. and the next response that should be done.

As the company that relied LBRY protocol & its interface, Odysee, this meeting gathers all key divisions to address all things from concern, to the response actions.

The meeting takes place in Saorfa dimension. I will talk to all gamers, and after each speech each day, all participants submits their talk, such as concerns, and idea of actions.

Since our beloved friend has been murdered, I also have no choice, but to allow each division to confer with me, in a closed manner, when they inclined to for whenever time. It's so bad, as we usually never ever allow anybody in any division to declare a closed meeting, due to philosophy in our company. The reason that this forcedly had to be done is because we received extra request of the division members, to propose actions that would harm us if known to, especially proprietarists, and silencers like SEC in USA, Earth. There is no rest assuring at all for this one. Such vile act done by the councils out there at SEC from USA, Earth proves a still ever existing silence of speech, ironically despite the philosophy in America, pertaining Freedom of speech, and basically, entire earth, pertaining human rights, and honest works that be useful for beings in general.

## Meeting 1

Hello, gamers. This is our first day of our emergency meeting here in Perkedel Technologies.

You have all been gathered here for grave matters regarding to the tools we use everyday to share our words.

- https://odysee.com/@lbry:3f/0720LBRYTranscript:7

As you may have known, last Saturday was the greatest negative shock of news, that LBRY inc. the company behind LBRY Protocol and owner of its interface, Odysee, has been murdered, by their own nation's organisation, SEC. LBRY was accused by SEC for violating law, stating that these LBC constitute a requirement to be registered as security and such on. LBRY has battled against, have lost, and as the result cause immense loss and debt upon LBRY. So much, that LBRY had no choice but to declare defunct and bankruptcy, liquidating all of the assets they have in order to pay those debts to SEC. In summary, all this was done in favour of merely egotistical political reasons, as ironic it looks, that there are more similar crypto related organisation that unlike the only LBRY, serves nothing but bunch of *quack cures* and *fancy bottled borjang tea*, in addition to huge gap and hurdle just to get started (wtf, QORTAL, get me the f888 in!!!). I have full faith, that say gamers were about to register Odysee very late, they may still be able to start prosper, with the just at least watch video rewards & invitings, they still could, even has been worsened to the worst these day (we have yet to receive report of late comers unable to post videos to LBRY for the 1st time, but DM Prefix `I_TOO_POOR_TO_START_LBRY` send screenshot still open).

Despite of such bloody fatalities, the LBRY protocol and related stuffs shall continue to work as normal. Although, we began to concern about this entire fate of the protocol and the blockchains in it. In addition, the content itself only works like regular Torrent, as it was once stated by the LBRY in white paper at certain page (pls sauce), restated again in above article that **Contents shall be seeded in order for them to survive**. Helping to achieve this requirement is as simple as keeping the miner runs and/or having the LBRY Desktop App daemon steady all time in a system session. Odysee, as the main and large seeder are promised to keep their way of doing LBRY, as is, by seeding and serving gamers the contents from across nodes that mine and seeds. However, was concerned that they may betray us from it, **the pledge has already signed**, therefore shall be lesser of concern today and some forth. We advise all gamers though, to be vigilant as always.

Now. Let us discuss the action we shall do next in response of all this incident. Despite everything works as normal, by having the author perished will create instability and chance for the system to crumbles. Therefore, we ask all gamers to provide us all ideas and to agree ones, about what shall we do, with our files, where as it was created, edited, rendered, to be uploaded, as well as 3rd party files we use in our creation of this Cinematic Universe and miscelaneous.

In addition to the discussion, since LBRY was unexpectedly murdered by someone who has sole interest in unecessary politics without bringing any good impacts for the people, we left with no choice, **but to allow times for all participants involved in discussion done in closed manner** where everyone also provides us ideas and to agree ones, which are considered risky and exposes nothing but harm if known by especially proprietarist and silencer, across galaxies. This is the first time ever, we opened this philoshophy violating opportunity, and is not a moment good idea to celebrate, rather, to sorrow and anger upon. For those who would like to recon, Perkedel Technologies is company of Open Source, and all meetings as all as possible are open source. Every documents of the meeting result as is (redacting possible identifying identities if it would harm ones) are shared for all gamers to see. This time is different. The silencer are out there and are on watch against us. These ideas you are eager to provide will give information to unwanted enemies that will leads us to our defeat, and loss of lives. Therefore, at the session of this closed meeting after the usual, Viorfa are asked to turn off all recording equipments, take off the power, discharge any electricity stored in capacitors, take off the memory storage and bring them out of this dimension, as well as all the camera. If the recording equipment has internal memory, then those, has to be expelled from this dimension. All participants may store what you have learned during this session in your head (and cyber are also allowed to remember, currently). You have to fortify your mind with security system if you haven't already if you haven't yet applied one, in event of a silencer attempting to extract your head without consent taking important memories about this part of meeting, they shall not be able to. We advise all gamers to against encrypting any bits in your head due to proven risk and dangers which again is lethal. You as well have to lock your house door (or stay in this Saorfa hotel) and avoid going outside before I declare to next other weekend.

Alright. Let us begin open discussion, followed by closed discussion. Before we start, since you are now recommended to stay in Saorfa hotel here, until another Sunday, you may first use this time to go back to your workspace and pack up necessary work stuffs, including ALL of your families. Then come back here, and in 2 hours is the discussion.

Arn: Please require. It's no longer safe.

Yes?

Oh, required. Apologies. You are now required to stay in Saorfa hotel. It seems, the silencer has begun sharpening their bullets.

## Meeting 2

Hello gamers. This has been a day we are here on a grave matter, for now in this second day.

<!-- open MIDI repo on meeting 3, wednesday -->

As you all have submitted the plan, we conclude that our course of action is clear. Is to open up opportunity for all gamers to contribute, even just to leech and seed. Our trust with LBRY is the peak, but we must stay vigilant and shall not rely only by 1, but more. I once said, *2 is better than one*, and shall be further done in more sectors after the previous. We must again, to let everyone at least spread the treasures so they will be even harder to gone. You gamers will be welcome to join us contributing not only by sending your files right your own art, but also somebody's art along with the authorship information as all as possible, but also to keep treasures of humanity exists forever and ever. This, not only make lives calm, but also let generations by generations enjoy, the creativity of this generations, predecessors, and will be for the future. If one thing has to dissipate, then only we can do is to get to the core of the work, wrap, sample, preserve and eternalize, so new generations can once again experience what has been extinct in their day far in the future. We will not repeat the same mistake of Alexander, if that was considered to be, and all gamers shall be the branch and mirror center of the Alexander. One burn, thousands grows. Let all see and experiences the quotes of the past, and this time exists and not gone.

Starting tomorrow, all gamers will be opened for the opportunity to join this spreading. Beginning from our one of our largest collection, to even the impossibly too large collections. You will no longer required to contact us to register in the friendship, and now shall be just plug and play. To clone and archive, and regularly pull as time goes. Fork to everywhere to unimaginable places from just to leech and seed, to contribute rare treasures, all will be welcome in a moment.

We understand all your concern regarding the risk and threats imposed by Earth people such Alexandrias are hosted at. There is once again no rest assured, but a disclaimer that we will not reupload any of the treasures whose still actively on sale or available, and only if they are gone or gratefully the author consents, shall those to be included as immediate as possible. Gamers are welcome to notify us if there are any actively on sale files (never gone) that we accidentally included, and we will gladly hack the history of the Alexandria to make ammend. Beware, that since there are too many files to handle this occurence, we advise all gamers to avoid abusing (or probably not to use) this feature since meddling the history of a git repo basically is dark magic and imposes an immmense risk of its own, creating chance of huge irrecoverable damages, and invalidates entire numbers of mirrors across the galaxies. Alexandria purpose is to ungone file and prevent them from disappearing in a fire. Both active and inactive files shall be there to commemorate the memories beings made throughout the history. If you insist however, we may only allow ammends through simple removal, but gamers has rights to pick the history before and unremove them in their own mirroring repositories, due to your unwanted behaviours (but actively on sale stuffs may not be accepted until we believe authors beholding the files never return it, or just happened to be gone).

Now, we will begin slowly, starting from one. Then the next is the other. After all is done, we will continue the process of organizing and adding treasures to the shelves slowly, and as all as we can.

There will be huge bonus if you decided to join us in official capacity. However, the term is not that simple to follow. The full terms and conditions will be written later. But short I would plan, is that you must let us shelve and share your files you placed in, and you must also have all of your files to the core used to make your file be included here, without exception (except passwords, API Keys, etc.). All must be here, where all available that made the binary works in the first place. With that accomplish, you will receive a badge file from me (`AMEMBER.txt`), in your folder to have gamers appreciate you, and considers you a Chad. This badge cannot be taken lightly, and shall only be used to remind that you are the Chad people crave, and willing to continue to be so.  To join, simply fork, and add your files. Then Pull request. If we can confirm that is as all it seems, you will be rewarded. Continue your effort and you shall receive more.

Are there any punishment if you betray? As usual, yes. And gamers in here know, nobody wants `NOTORIOUS.txt` or any bad badges. Therefore, be careful of your action, and you shall prevail. Until you repent from your bad behaviours and returned all the files along with the opportunities, you shall be forgiven.

Alright. Is there any other things to discuss?

## Meeting 3

My apologies. We have no meeting today. I am very busy right now doing desperation protocols. But I already read and heard your submission.

Our discussion still open for certain times. And depending on how safe now after all these, you will be home soon or later, either one by division or all at once.

Once again, division Archives has announced that one of the member, decided to open up opportunities for all gamers to join in the preservation of medias. Like usual, through here you can directly send your treasures to them, or to simply leech and seed. All welcome. The ones that not welcome are those who seeks destruction on ground of your selfish act of upholding non-fungibilities. ones and zeros (later onezeros in quantum) are meant to flow free, free from shackles from the author who architected those bits. When everyone allows all gamers to enjoy such crafts, all enjoys and prosper upon all these creativities, be inspired, and let others know, such crafts do exist. While ones may impose rule to ensure they are known as ones who made it, the utmost important thing is to have all gamers ensure crafts keeps existing and never disipates by time into the nullness, or any neglect one of gamers could do.

We appreciate their effort and all shall follow their example.

Return to your discussion. We have certain times until this event ended.

Oh yeah btw, I am right now experimenting stuffs, that **My Ko-Fi now accepts donation command**. Currently this is only for 1 type of job.

KOFI = https://ko-fi.com/joelwindows7

If you put donation message, beginning with `PLS_CONVERT_TO_BLENDER`, followed by your paper hand drawn sketch (SAUCE URL), and optionally your contact PM, then I will read it and convert your drawing into a Blender Scene. **Don't expect the quality**, because I have other jobs. This is here to get me out of desperation protocols I was doing. Example:

> $3  
>
> PLS_CONVERT_TO_BLENDER
>
> https://example.com my drawing

Any amounts are accepted, and once we have it, we will analyze whether this business model is worth building to the next stage.

I accept the following sub-business type:

- Just convert your sketch. Send Sauce URL of an Image file
- Uncensor censor-by-paywall art by remaking with just available resources. Send Sauce URL of an Image file that intentionally tampered by authors themselves, and optionally the paid untampered version of it. Please state the full author URLs: the social media you got this from, and untampered sauce URL where did you got it from (if you put untampered version, you must give the sauce even it's not the buy treon, but the sparsdat of it). No original image will be inserted into the Blender file, unless the image is licensed CC4.0-BY-SA maximum (including that ironically paywalled ones).
- Interpret text prompt. Yep, I will at my best interpret and see if this is much better than AI's depiction. More the detail, the better. But again, **Do not expect quality**. **Expect the soul!**

Following experiment above disallows refund, therefore gamers should consider carefully before partaking this experiment. There is no financial reward, but other treasures you and other gamers can enjoy later.

Kolmorolotzzet = Sorry, this repository is 69420. Please ask Archives member, Admiral Zumi. You must be biologically mature!

## Meeeting 4

There is no meeting today.

However, we have been notified by Viorfa, that there is a fatal bug. Despite being not related to LBRY at all, this is absolutely cannot be ignored.

https://youtu.be/Kyc_ysVgBMs?si=Tlv2Vh2CnWQWPcSY (The placeholder image is not the photo)

**DO NOT SEND A PHOTO OF A PERSON EATING POPCORN WEARING HEADPHONE!!!!!!**  
Discord's PhotoDNA image scan will think you are posting CP, ban account no mercy no email, and report you to authorities and have you castracted for being this kind of person. Despite being not an unusual image, this bug has murdered thousands of gamers across galaxies, not physically, but mentally.

This is not exageration, and NTTS has tested this and indeed it triggers.

If any gamers are involved of sharing this file for grounds of dooming other gamer either beef or prank, your spirit ID will be reported to me and I will deem you unworthy of existing no longer (worse, recycle to scratch), due to sheer amount of damage this could be inflicted upon, and how eternal it is. This file is now considered radioactive, and shall not be inserted into any normal database of any kind. Report immediately if you found such file that fits this description and DO NOT attempt to hunt the original file. If you are considering remaking the scene out of the above prompt (provided be different than the look & the hash would match against), I recommend that you never put it into Discord or any suspected / alleged PhotoDNA enabled applications.

If you have any questions let us know right away. Thank you.

## Meeting 5

There is no meeting today.

As always, you can submit your idea for me to read & discuss about right here during our week of this event.

In addition to this event, noted since 21st October 2023 (2023-10-21) at the death of LBRY inc. the company behind LBRY protocol, We have declared another event in our tradition of Perkedel Technologies, the 40 & 1. Where 40 days of death, and 1 year of death. We honor what LBRY inc. has done to us, from where we begun our journey to trust this protocol and so this day even their demise of an unprecendented murder. This honor marks an important step of acknowledgement, such essential their system they have created, opening wide and abundant of opportunities for all of us gamers.

The 40 day post demise assembly will be held on 22nd November 2023 (`2023-11-22`), and 1 year post demise will be held the same death date next year at 21st October 2024 (`2024-10-21`). All of the Viorfa & Archives members are required to come, as the topic of the person is about Media, where the division that matches the topic are Viorfa & Archives. However, since the entity is not just a public figure, all are invitted and are optional to come, **but it's recommended come**, especially if you have been loyal to LBRY no matter knicks and knacks, as well as the gold and platinum during your day with the said protocol. The center of the event is at Saorfa again, however this time, there is no specific place. All welcome to join remotely.

## Meeting 6

<!-- Transcript reminder: Made mistake of publishing lost media to Kaorfa's main channel, wait until transaction confirmed & then immediately reedit to point to Zumi's channel -->

There is no meeting today.

We are getting close to the final day. I thank you for all your contribution in this event as we speak. Great luck, & God Bless you.

Dismissal instruction is in progress. We are currently analyzing situation whether or not it is safe to get out now after we have finished here. While you are being subsidized for the stays, it is recommended that we all can come back to our homes and return to our workplace normally. The Saorfa hotel is not yet ready for normal commercial use at the moment, and was designed for emergency safe keeping purpose for entities under threats. Therefore we hope for the best.

As usual, any concern post this event, and any other question are always open for submission.

Oh yeah, one more.

We have just received a good news depending on how expectful you are. Today, it is the day, that we introduce you: Polycentric.

- https://gitlab.futo.org/polycentric/polycentric/
- https://polycentric.io/
- https://docs.polycentric.io/
- https://gitlab.futo.org/polycentric/harbor
- https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.futo.harbor_flutter

What this does is to link all your social medias in one place. Well, you can say that there is already a linktree, so why this?

Good question. **It adds verifications** beside of just adding your account URLs to your tree! If it goes to that Polycentric, that mean this channel & accounts on other platform is confirmed, **belongs to one**. Therefore should be more difficult to impersonate other accounts, if you cannot have access of editing it, since you have to place the token in the account description / bio.

Is there is already application of this protocol? luckily, yes! The [Grayjay](https://grayjay.app) ([video here](https://youtu.be/2jyRhiP2Oso?si=hUv2dQr6Mur9EVTP) & [here](https://youtu.be/Ln4rsxWq3WM?si=XHOeJwXs6QM2sNQU))! This is to play videos from the channels ones claimed in their polycentric (and if haven't, it shows as a separate own channel name until claimed). Now, you can play video **ONLY JUST IN ONE APP**, and **even download every single of them!!** No need to jump to YouTube, jump to Odysee, jump to whatever video social app idk my disk full & they could brick my phone soon.

GrayJay also features its own social features such as Like Dislike, Comments and soon others. With your Polycentric account, you can interact with others and more, right here. Plus, **There is no crypto hurdle**, and in fact, **it is not crypto**. All you have to do, is to generate yourself a Polycentric account if you haven't made one already, and start your adventure. If you have channels in your platform, You should also link them all together with [Harbor app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.futo.harbor_flutter). Login with the same Polycentric, and start claiming all of them.

**STORE YOUR POLYCENTRIC URL LIKE A PASSWORD!!!** Perkedel nor FUTO will not be responsible for act of neglect, contributing loss or stolen of your Polycentric accounts and all your claims. I have a suggestion, that they should also add password field to decrypt everything, just saying. like Username Password something2.

This is not sponsored of course. In fact, I currently have a difficulty to buy this app, due to limited & unfamiliar payment system choice (and for obvious reason, PayPal I think they also believe that they are a bunch of bad guys). Worry not, like WinRAR, there is no loss of features for not paying it, although again, if you are in US and has the money, **pls buy it**. They earned it. All and all, I have already concluded this worthy for you to trust now. Unlike WinRAR, they are also Source Available (despite the license being not standard due to sheer amount of scam modifying other open source video social projects & putting bunch of nasty stuffs in it). *Open Source*, that you can fork it and do anything, except the aforementioned scamming, which the license forbids. Again, you do not need to edit the source code, because as far as I have tried, there is no visible nor significant of feature loss detected. Until I find, you may trust this system now. Pay whenever you can.

I really wonder if pressing go to Stripe would open up a single time payment page like as if we purchasing something from a website powered by Shopify (insert card no need login & go). I hope for this. I shall explore further later, I promise.

The steps and instruction on how to participate in these new systems are later to be written. You may for now visit my Harbor page at https://harbor.social/CAESRwokCAESIEO0rnpfJZ2ckTDNbO1rIuR7DigDaNi9yXw5m4bMFUyiEh9odHRwczovL3NydjEtc3RnLnBvbHljZW50cmljLmlv .

## Meeting 7 Final

<!-- Videos upload to wrong Kaorfa channel, YouTube backup. reedit original channel was the solution, put to default. -->

We have reached the final day, and we are closing this event.

Thank you for your participation in this very important event. It has been the most sorrowful day, such egregious act done by their own government, ever in history. May this be the lesson, to not follow suit what have they done to them, then all of us. We have been honored, to be with the side of the revolution in video uploading platform movement. To be free from shackles of ones control, and own our own made creatives and to help others achieve the same. We would not be in the foreverness at all, if LBRY was never been here. Our journey, no matter what happened is not vain, and has since provides abundant amount of fruititions for all of us gamers. May LBRY inc. rest easy, and the LBRY protocols & related endeavours continues, prospers, forever, and after. Once again, thank you, for gathering together, doing for the people.

As for the dismissal, I have decided that the door will be open 5 days again after, for safety reasons. After that, you may come back home with your Portalers. I recommend that you set the destination right away to your home. If you had job equipments, be sure to first return them in one spot close beforehand. Wait 2 days more, you can still declare your usual prayers, then on that monday you may resume job normally.

For those who asked, Please note, I have concluded that GrayJay is not replacement for video hosting, in fact they are not. GrayJay is designed only to aggregate videos from various platforms, into 1 center an app. Videos will still be uploaded through original platform, but once you have linked your channels, your Polycentric video channel page will become one and only.

Speaking of linking, Yes, I have the same couple issues, and Linus Media Group would also be, if he also inclined to join. As what I have seen, every new channel we linked with Harbor, will be pushed to the first position in array. Therefore the last will be firstmost. This is why you'll see Admiral Zumi's files instead of mine, because I linked Zumi's channel last, Twitch, then bunch of backup YouTube channels. GrayJay at the moment can only pick one YouTube, one Odysee, and one of each possible to be linked whenever can to our Polycentric account / wallet. Removing them to be readded on separate Polycentric account seems not a good idea. **Worry less**, this is GrayJay's fault. your harbor.social account can still list all accounts you linked and you can click these array of accounts to go to respective page on respective platform. As now you should remember again that **GrayJay is still under construction / WIP**.

Full disclosure, **I already purchased GrayJay**, fulfilling my promise. They earned it and they are worthy. Despite juuuust one license that is absolutely not okay, this time, I tolerated them, due to sheer amount of stealings and scamming happened for the topic of `3rd party platform video player`, much like I tolerated some artist who has enormous fear & traumas after being ransacked by irresponsible AI fusioners, using their creative works unethically and without proper credit nor permission (if need be), to mix and frankenstein their work, stealing not only clout, but all the deserves they crave and deserved. Using Stripe as FUTO and GrayJay team used has been proven to be very easy and effective. Since it's their own, away from PayPal, you use your credit / debit card which explains why the need to use your virtual card syndicator system ([Privacy.com](https://privacy.com) card for US). You only need to pay once and forever, and once you've filled in your data, the license key should be inserted to your email, and you can simply insert that key to `I already paid`. **Ensure to safekeep this key like password or in this case, a Windows Product Key**. To retain respect, please do not share the key to complete strangers, and to help you retain respect, **GrayJay once again still works 1 to 1 no cripple even if you don't pay**, much like WinRAR, minus the 40 days window, minus the Open Source License, but plus no annoyance. Because they believe, we are a customer, not slave. These instructions will also be included in GrayJay instruction. May the Android emulator ready, for the screenshot purpose. Until this change, You should begin to participate joining and helping them for their endeavours.

Again, just to remind you in template, **There is no such thing such as `GrayJay will have issue you must give XXXXX`**. Do not listen and immediately block them, as they are people of deceptions / scammer. **Do not give anything, especially your private keys!!** We learned the lesson and we must be more vigilant everyday, as deceptions are getting more advanced and more less obvious, even hacking official networks somehow to scare all of us like bunch of sorcerers did to BCA in Indonesia at some point. The dialog did appear, but BCA already stated it's false, and they were hacked, and have fixed it since. Or worse, using anything that would end its domain like official, like did happened to [Jim Browning](https://youtu.be/YIWV5fSaUB8?si=tZEBXqWFfnbVlWrl) few years back. My God, I thought I was the poopy idiot and thought I can bash God that I think He took my vigillance away, nope that's not true. Jim's worse than mine, like God desperately sent His angel to prevent me from planning any bad things against God in vengeance for taking my vigillance away I thought. Me Steam accidental report scares with obvious Discord not Steam support chat, then Jim's YouTube accuse multi ad account will be banned with Google's offknown (it's real, Official) Support something chatting place. something at Google dot com, those scammers kept finding ideas. same scare, would be banned, gets smarted and harder to stay vigillant more days passes.

**But all back both mine & Jim's. And still fine.**

And That is all for this week's event. Remember your date. 40 and 1. Thancc for your attention.
