# LBRY Murdered

This is record of the broadcasted meeting discussing the murder of LBRY inc. and the next response that should be done.

As the company that relied LBRY protocol & its interface, Odysee, this meeting gathers all key divisions to address all things from concern, to the response actions.

The meeting takes place in Saorfa dimension. I will talk to all gamers, and after each speech each day, all participants submits their talk, such as concerns, and idea of actions.

Since our beloved friend has been murdered, I also have no choice, but to allow each division to confer with me, in a closed manner, when they inclined to for whenever time. It's so bad, as we usually never ever allow anybody in any division to declare a closed meeting, due to philosophy in our company. The reason that this forcedly had to be done is because we received extra request of the division members, to propose actions that would harm us if known to, especially proprietarists, and silencers like SEC in USA, Earth. There is no rest assuring at all for this one. Such vile act done by the councils out there at SEC from USA, Earth proves a still ever existing silence of speech, ironically despite the philosophy in America, pertaining Freedom of speech, and basically, entire earth, pertaining human rights, and honest works that be useful for beings in general.

## Meeting 1

Hello, gamers. This is our first day of our emergency meeting here in Perkedel Technologies.

You have all been gathered here for grave matters regarding to the tools we use everyday to share our words.

As you may have known, last Saturday was the greatest negative shock of news, that LBRY inc. the company behind LBRY Protocol and owner of its interface, Odysee, has been murdered, by their own nation's organisation, SEC. LBRY was accused by SEC for violating law, stating that these LBC constitute a requirement to be registered as security and such on. LBRY has battled against, have lost, and as the result cause immense loss and debt upon LBRY. So much, that LBRY had no choice but to declare defunct and bankruptcy, liquidating all of the assets they have in order to pay those debts to SEC. In summary, all this was done in favour of merely egotistical political reasons, as ironic it looks, that there are more similar crypto related organisation that unlike the only LBRY, serves nothing but bunch of *quack cures* and *fancy bottled borjang tea*, in addition to huge gap and hurdle just to get started (wtf, QORTAL, get me the f888 in!!!). I have full faith, that say gamers were about to register Odysee very late, they may still be able to start prosper, with the just at least watch video rewards & invitings, they still could, even has been worsened to the worst these day (we have yet to receive report of late comers unable to post videos to LBRY for the 1st time, but DM Prefix `I_TOO_POOR_TO_START_LBRY` send screenshot still open).

Despite of such bloody fatalities, the LBRY protocol and related stuffs shall continue to work as normal. Although, we began to concern about this entire fate of the protocol and the blockchains in it. In addition, the content itself only works like regular Torrent, as it was once stated by the LBRY in white paper at certain page (pls sauce), restated again in above article that **Contents shall be seeded in order for them to survive**. Helping to achieve this requirement is as simple as keeping the miner runs and/or having the LBRY Desktop App daemon steady all time in a system session. Odysee, as the main and large seeder are promised to keep their way of doing LBRY, as is, by seeding and serving gamers the contents from across nodes that mine and seeds. However, was concerned that they may betray us from it, **the pledge has already signed**, therefore shall be lesser of concern today and some forth. We advise all gamers though, to be vigilant as always.

Now. Let us discuss the action we shall do next in response of all this incident. Despite everything works as normal, by having the author perished will create instability and chance for the system to crumbles. Therefore, we ask all gamers to provide us all ideas and to agree ones, about what shall we do, with our files, where as it was created, edited, rendered, to be uploaded, as well as 3rd party files we use in our creation of this Cinematic Universe and miscelaneous.

In addition to the discussion, since LBRY was unexpectedly murdered by someone who has sole interest in unecessary politics without bringing any good impacts for the people, we left with no choice, **but to allow times for all participants involved in discussion done in closed manner** where everyone also provides us ideas and to agree ones, which are considered risky and exposes nothing but harm if known by especially proprietarist and silencer, across galaxies. This is the first time ever, we opened this philoshophy violating opportunity, and is not a moment good idea to celebrate, rather, to sorrow and anger upon. For those who would like to recon, Perkedel Technologies is company of Open Source, and all meetings as all as possible are open source. Every documents of the meeting result as is (redacting possible identifying identities if it would harm ones) are shared for all gamers to see. This time is different. The silencer are out there and are on watch against us. These ideas you are eager to provide will give information to unwanted enemies that will leads us to our defeat, and loss of lives. Therefore, at the session of this closed meeting after the usual, Viorfa are asked to turn off all recording equipments, take off the power, discharge any electricity stored in capacitors, take off the memory storage and bring them out of this dimension, as well as all the camera. If the recording equipment has internal memory, then those, has to be expelled from this dimension. All participants may store what you have learned during this session in your head (and cyber are also allowed to remember, currently). You have to fortify your mind with security system if you haven't already if you haven't yet applied one, in event of a silencer attempting to extract your head without consent taking important memories about this part of meeting, they shall not be able to. We advise all gamers to against encrypting any bits in your head due to proven risk and dangers which again is lethal. You as well have to lock your house door (or stay in this Saorfa hotel) and avoid going outside before I declare to next other weekend.

Alright. Let us begin open discussion, followed by closed discussion. Before we start, since you are now recommended to stay in Saorfa hotel here, until another Sunday, you may first use this time to go back to your workspace and pack up necessary work stuffs, including ALL of your families. Then come back here, and in 2 hours is the discussion.

Arn: Please require. It's no longer safe.

Yes?

Oh, required. Apologies. You are now required to stay in Saorfa hotel. It seems, the silencer has begun sharpening their bullets.

## Meeting 2

Hello gamers. This has been a day we are here on a grave matter, for now in this second day.

<!-- open MIDI repo on meeting 3, wednesday -->

As you all have submitted the plan, we conclude that our course of action is clear. Is to open up opportunity for all gamers to contribute, even just to leech and seed. Our trust with LBRY is the peak, but we must stay vigilant and shall not rely only by 1, but more. I once said, *2 is better than one*, and shall be further done in more sectors after the previous. We must again, to let everyone at least spread the treasures so they will be even harder to gone. You gamers will be welcome to join us contributing not only by sending your files right your own art, but also somebody's art along with the authorship information as all as possible, but also to keep treasures of humanity exists forever and ever. This, not only make lives calm, but also let generations by generations enjoy, the creativity of this generations, predecessors, and will be for the future. If one thing has to dissipate, then only we can do is to get to the core of the work, wrap, sample, preserve and eternalize, so new generations can once again experience what has been extinct in their day far in the future. We will not repeat the same mistake of Alexander, if that was considered to be, and all gamers shall be the branch and mirror center of the Alexander. One burn, thousands grows. Let all see and experiences the quotes of the past, and this time exists and not gone.

Starting tomorrow, all gamers will be opened for the opportunity to join this spreading. Beginning from our one of our largest collection, to even the impossibly too large collections. You will no longer required to contact us to register in the friendship, and now shall be just plug and play. To clone and archive, and regularly pull as time goes. Fork to everywhere to unimaginable places from just to leech and seed, to contribute rare treasures, all will be welcome in a moment.

We understand all your concern regarding the risk and threats imposed by Earth people such Alexandrias are hosted at. There is once again no rest assured, but a disclaimer that we will not reupload any of the treasures whose still actively on sale or available, and only if they are gone or gratefully the author consents, shall those to be included as immediate as possible. Gamers are welcome to notify us if there are any actively on sale files (never gone) that we accidentally included, and we will gladly hack the history of the Alexandria to make ammend. Beware, that since there are too many files to handle this occurence, we advise all gamers to avoid abusing (or probably not to use) this feature since meddling the history of a git repo basically is dark magic and imposes an immmense risk of its own, creating chance of huge irrecoverable damages, and invalidates entire numbers of mirrors across the galaxies. Alexandria purpose is to ungone file and prevent them from disappearing in a fire. Both active and inactive files shall be there to commemorate the memories beings made throughout the history. If you insist however, we may only allow ammends through simple removal, but gamers has rights to pick the history before and unremove them in their own mirroring repositories, due to your unwanted behaviours (but actively on sale stuffs may not be accepted until we believe authors beholding the files never return it, or just happened to be gone).

Now, we will begin slowly, starting from one. Then the next is the other. After all is done, we will continue the process of organizing and adding treasures to the shelves slowly, and as all as we can.

There will be huge bonus if you decided to join us in official capacity. However, the term is not that simple to follow. The full terms and conditions will be written later. But short I would plan, is that you must let us shelve and share your files you placed in, and you must also have all of your files to the core used to make your file be included here, without exception (except passwords, API Keys, etc.). All must be here, where all available that made the binary works in the first place. With that accomplish, you will receive a badge file from me (`AMEMBER.txt`), in your folder to have gamers appreciate you, and considers you a Chad. This badge cannot be taken lightly, and shall only be used to remind that you are the Chad people crave, and willing to continue to be so.  To join, simply fork, and add your files. Then Pull request. If we can confirm that is as all it seems, you will be rewarded. Continue your effort and you shall receive more.

Are there any punishment if you betray? As usual, yes. And gamers in here know, nobody wants `NOTORIOUS.txt` or any bad badges. Therefore, be careful of your action, and you shall prevail. Until you repent from your bad behaviours and returned all the files along with the opportunities, you shall be forgiven.

Alright. Is there any other things to discuss?
