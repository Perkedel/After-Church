# Family Feud: Tributestuck

Let's bring all Alternians into the game this time. [here sauce](https://www.tumblr.com/joelwindows7/717556016495116288/red-and-blue-teams-in-family-feud-with-hussie-as?source=share ). big shoutout to `lowqualityhomestuckedits`!!!

Left. `RED`:

1. Terezi Pyrope
2. Gamzee Makara
3. Tavros Nitram
4. Vriska Serket
5. Kanaya Maryam
6. Karkat Vantas (Extra)

Right. `BLUE`:

1. Equius Zahhak
2. Aradia Megido
3. Nepeta Leijon
4. Eridan Ampora
5. Feferi Peixes
6. Sollux Captor (Extra)

Yep, instead of by family, it's after the original team layout in the original Homestuck. Hope they don't got trauma trigger if they had, yeah hopefully. The team intels have been collected by fans from many Homestuck pages & more, [as you can see here](https://mspaintadventures.fandom.com/wiki/Troll_teams ). Hmm looks like the image edit is out of order or something, but **who cares?!** we're no longer playing Sburb anymore here in Perkedel Cinematic Universe, we're playing Hexagon Engine! big shoutout to Juan Linietsky & friends for the realization solutions, [Godot Engine](https://godotengine.org).

Things Andrew Hussie needs to know:

- Andrew here uses Homestuck persona. the actor for this is preferably that Andrew Hussie himself. Yess, we're not Hollywood who clashly hired big artist for iconic characters. Luckily it wasn't that cringe last time, thancc Illumination.
- **Do not lift up bad past!!** & just do not bring up whatever complex and traumatic battle today at all. I mean anything that makes your character here uncomfortable severely. Anything after all the Homestuck, 2, and everything, moved on. It's new day, I have resimplified everything, fixed everything, upgraded everything. E.g. If you see Vriska seems to have only 2 pupils, that's because we have balanced & merged her eye specs to be even more powerful, while still maintaining it. Well if you want we can have multi pupil on left eye, idk, I haven't realized that. Maybe should keep it looks this way.
- No, uhh We fixed everything **AS MUCH AS WE CAN**. not everything. alot of things are still being figured out, your franchise is pretty hard to port to be compatible with my universe man, wow.
- You are in Perkedel Cinematic Universe. Yes, my friend. it's my fanfic universe. I got many franchises here, not just OCs.
- Be careful with Tavros! we have upgraded his horns to be very strong. At will he can turn on high damage per collision.
- Final answer, Terezi has been unblinded. I know you already have unblinded Terezi, but here we also ugraded her eyes as well as her entire skin so it can 3D scan like starnose mole.
- Alternians have learned how to use modern typing system here on modern version of operating systems: Windows 11, Android, Linux with Gnome and so on. Therefore these captions will be typed with emoji. So please don't be surprised as Nepeta now uses `⬅️` or any point arrow emoji to `bitwise insert` her prefix face. Sorry, but in Markdown, there is strict rules & syntax guidelines. If only there is custom emoji so Tavros' emoji can also have horns `}:/`, idk.
- Relax, if you have off script actions you'd like to speak than below document, feel free to speak so as long it still good & does not waste time, idk.. Hollywood films does that, ask Tom Holand!
- uhhh

Win 300 points. when you win, you got your Kvz.

After that, there is fast money.

The last one a.k.a. Extra plays first! There supposed to be 5 each team.

Using part inspire from classic Family Feud (e.g. family photo style team reveals) for the element of surprise

## Pre-game

Quinzor Matahualar: (enter backstage)... Okay, all of you have arrived. Cool and Good. Now, you see that 2 box there?

Vriska Serket: Okay..

Quinzor: Alright. You first enter, after the box there will be further instructions you await for. Before you... angery..

Terezi: OHHHH, TH1S GOTT4 BE SUS DO3SN'T 1T?

Quinzor: I know, I know. I hate to trigger your trauma if you had in prevous days. But hear me out. we're just to have fun. The reason that we're here really.. will be revealed by Kaorfa after this game.

Terezi: 1 R34LLY W4NT TO KNOW, JO3L!!!!

Quinzor: Yeah yeah, pls wait. Just play the game. It'll be fun, despite that you're going to... versus, in a way... words. you know?

Terezi: (sigh)... WH4T3V3R, M4N.

Quinzor: Okay, we're good? Jokin?

Jokinever Matahualar: Siap Bosqu! (pull string to reveal scroll of playerlist)!!!

(See player list top of this document!)

*Alternians*: (saw) Oooo, what??

Quinzor: (awkward smile) Eheeu heeu....

Terezi: (remembered this teaming in the original Sburb) oh... th4t..

Quinzor: Look I'm sorry, I just..

Vriska: It's okay. I like to have fun.

Terezi: WH4T DO YOU M34N?!?!

Vriska: No no, not like that. C'mon guys, it's past already.

Terezi: .... (too lazy to relift this long time ago issue anymore) 33gh, WH4T3V3R, L3T'S JUST MOV3 ON. WH3R3 DO W3 ST4RT?

Quinzor: So you just get into the box according to your name. in the tarp door where you'll come out next, you follow the pose. Oh, make sure you also sit & stand, according to your name. Yeah, the pose for all is clear, c'mon. (async) we left 5 minutes, gotta prepare that before it's time. Act casually, like uhh you being having a family photo in 1980s something. Take **Khong Guan** can! that's how basically it looks like!

*Alternians*: (async) (go to their respective box & start posing according to the instruction on the door)....

Nepeta Leijon: `:33` ⬅️ Ooo, sit on the floorr ? **CAT POSE?!?!**, PURRFECTO!!

Aradia Megido: 0000, nice cl0ck!

Info: mini tower antique clock, with round top, where the clock face is on that round top. Also sorry, the punctuation is mandatory for expressiveness. They'll be removed in the game caption & accessibilty setting force disabled.

Vriska: Guy, follow the pose!

Terezi: OH WOW, LONG CH41R, MY F4VOR1T3. (jump to it) 44444HHH...

Kanaya Maryam: (pose as a makeup addict, saw Musou Black Lipstick) Oh Yes, Musou Black! (take) Finally! (apply vigorously)!!!!!

Info: Makeup table set, with a Post-it note attached right side tilted 15 deg to right saying `SCREW YOU KAPOOR & YOUR BEAN`. Yes, Anish Kapoor somehow had Vantablack without letting us any, & he has Silver bean in Chicago.

Quinzor: Okay, everyone, if you want to be statue just to be authentic, you can, but feel free to move, coz you know.. `GIF`. Alright 1 minutes left! make sure the posing & the instruments are ready when the shot begins. Expect some alarm. that's where you prepare up. Relax! This is not strict game. I guess..

Kanaya: Hey how do I look?

Tavros Nitram: lOOK'S LIKE BLACKHOLE TO ME, wOW,,

Vriska: words coming out of blackhole, 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣!!! No no, looks cool though.

Kanaya: (felt appreciated) Ah, Yeah, ... I Like It. I Have Blackhole Mouth.. (giggle) Eheu HeuHeu..

Info: [Musou Black](https://www.the-black-market.com/marketplace/musou-black-paint/ ) is a black paint designed to make anything painted looks like void, as it absorbs over 99.9% of the light. Perhaps a retaliation alongside [Semple's Black](https://culturehustle.com/products/black-3-0-the-worlds-blackest-black-acrylic-paint-150ml ), to against Vantablack which Anish somehow got hands on unlike everybody else, **INCLUDING ME!!!**

Quinzor: Okay!! 30 seconds left!!

*everyone backstage*: (quickly finish up)

Jokinever: Okay, you stand here. don't worry, there'll be hints on the camera, it's teleprompt.

Andrew Hussie: Okay..

Jokinever: Semangat!!

Andrew: (don't get it) uhh??

Jokinever: uhh `spirit`??

Andrew: Ohh, (get it as `Ganbatte Kudasai` somekind) OKay I see. I'll try. (still shy) eumm...

Nepeta: `://` ⬅️ Hmmm, I don't see any catnip around here.. what a bummerrr.

Karkat Vantas: WELL OF COURSE, YOU CANNOT SHOW DRUGS ON TV.

Nepeta: `:((` ⬅️ Awww, Hey! I don't think that's drugs Karkat!! All pet stores has it!

Karkat: FOR THEM, MAYBE THEY FEAR WOULD BE FLAGGED..

## End

Medium, Medium, Medium. No, not the article. If on the original Homestuck you have the Medium, in Perkedel we have Blender Surreal Meme World. There, characters I have invited in to discuss about real issues in the World Of Arts. I will bring some of them various ways, like for Deltarune, it's through this portal chamber (this episode will talk about Paywallism). Now for Homestuck, I chose through Astral Projections (but haven't figured what the problem should be discussed). Yeah Dream Self all over again, but I assure you it's different. And don't be surprised, everyone including the gamers will & can only have simple primitive skins like Default Cube, other sample shapes, & these styles around it. that's because it's hard to find 3D model that matches them, and often times, they are either paid, private, expired, etc etc. You'll know further things later.

Also ugh.. wow.. [yoooooaaak](https://mspaintadventures.fandom.com/wiki/Quadrants )... You know what, did you mention these are essential marriage or anything dedicated 1 to 4 til life & certain div if..? no? ummm NO, I just do not support polygamy, but you do your being that being, aslkdfjklasdlkfhjklashgjksfhfusdfhfufihsdfjkfhfds heuh! this is.. awkward. See, how complicated! You know what, Screw this. No, keep these as is in the background, while I will have.... uhhh hmmm, I think I would trigger everyone here. Considering.. mnch!, sssss, Yeah uh.. 1 to 1, I have... installed these.. you know.. so they can have, 2 systems. Original & my inspired intentions, coz yeah while uh.. Actually no, not gonna despise that romance system, JUST, OH COMPLICATED, MY BRAIN EXPLODE!! PLS NO MORE WEIRD EDUCATION AGAIN! ENOUGH JUST 1 AND FOLLOW THIS CONVENTION FOR MOST HUMANOID BEINGS, IDK... HUAAAAAAA ajkdshfjlkahhwefahASJHDFLAHELFHALEHGFALJKSHGKJLA!!!!!! Oops, I'm sorry, I think I made the original system sounds like boring paying tax (do Alternian romance boringly just to ensure existence), while making God's Human intention.. God's intention as, wholesome, bla bla bla. Damn, pls don't cancel me. I just want to make games, & I have my thinking.

who character shift number?!?!?!? hmmmmmm like `! @ # $` while it's actually `one two three four`?

barhugut [612](https://mspaintadventures.fandom.com/wiki/612 ).

Hmm, looks like I just found serveral future descendants after all the originals like [here](https://mspaintadventures.fandom.com/wiki/Harry_Anderson_Egbert ). Yes, another fan collected intels, thancc gamers. Well I didn't say the date when all of my fanfics for this sector happens. Perhaps would be, after Friday Night Funkin' Full Ass released & we closed the Last Funkin Moment project? idk.... Look, Harry, I just showed you, recently born couple years ago in the middle of this war, yes passed indeed, COVID-19 global wars, thanccfully survived. Idk, but yeah. Some elements would be changed to reflect that war, especially mask. Man, gotta hire it up somebody. I haven't even started porting my framework yet! I wish I didn't busy hunting money just to live. Deuoh..
