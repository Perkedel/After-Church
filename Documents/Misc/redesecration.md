Once upon a time, there was this guy who is screwed up pervert. He was famous until got exposed, and entire galaxy hates him.

One day, there is a war, he was drafted as a sniper. As he got no more life, all lost, he get close, desperarely destroying enemy vessel driver. He got it, the vessel disabled and ultimately contributes to the victory. If it wasn't because of him, no victory. Unfortunately, after the enemy driver was shot, another enemy headshot him. He killed in action.

Guess what happened? No honor funeral. He just thrown like the same lowly he has been now. All that's because of the exposé. Where's the huge cry?! He was the one that let you all live!

I mean c'mon, superhero movies are better than this. The villain repent, fixed situation, enemy lost but ex-villain has to die. Then there's the honorary funeral. Now where, where is the funeral here?

He could've deserted himself. There's that escape wormhole on his right that leads you far and beyond return, very close to his fighter ship jet. He chose to fight instead. Died before he could desert. And yet, no honor, and all you think that he is a pervert, despite he moved on from it 5 months after exposé?!
