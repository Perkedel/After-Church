# It's been a tiring day here
I have been emburmishgated with lot of real life stuffs. Thesis handling is not easy at all, trust me. Lots of things went unclear and not obvious how do we do this. anyway..

We should wait for new version of the system, but unfortunately it has been canceled. However with this, the current system decided to continue instead. Have a look!

# A Tiring Day
## Somewhere in the [long hallway](https://gamebanana.com/members/899080 )
[an](https://gamebanana.com/responders/are?post=9369885 )

Prodeks Mentahan: (in a car cruising the hallway)...,

Prodeks: (found message & took picture with dashcam)...

Prodeks: (finally arrive at an interesting end spot & stop). (get out of car & lock car), (go towards a mysterius vending machine that has bean image skin on it).. ... (inspect, found that there is a button)... (Press button)!

Vending Machine: (bzzzt)!!! (emit large ultimate pickle jar).

Prodeks: (pick up pickle jar & bring home to Wakturia HQ).

## Wakturia, Dasandim
Gyouter Embinosa: So, how does the floating stone condition is?

Grevor Sritowi: So far so good sir. It's all working. Atmosphere ok, fake gravity ok, and they're ready to come now.

Gyouter: Great! Alright, Latsufir, your job.

Latsufir Umnaga: Yes sir! Here we go. (start monitoring the job execution)..

Prodeks: (enter the command center).

Gyouter: Prodeks! right, how's the journey going?

Prodeks: I have no idea what to say sir, the premise seems doesn't like anything chaotic, but beans.

Gyouter: Great. you got something?

Prodeks: I tried to get a bean the premise promised, but it broke, I got a jar of pickles. ‚òπÔ∏è

Gyouter: Wait! don't say bad word first, remember? We actually are ran out of pickles recently. So this one is fantastic!

Prodeks: Alright, if you say so, ugh! (lift the pickle jar and face to burger fans back right), **Borgir time!!!**, ohh!

Wenak Joms: Whoah! Where did you get that one?

Prodeks: Hallway beans.

Wenak: Finally! after all these.. months anyway. Alright, let's see the clock now! (check clock, it's 11.58 PM) Oh! it's gonna be lunch time! Right, I think we should all prepare stuffs first, c'mon Pro!

Prodeks: Alright, lunch room.

Gyouter: Actually, gotta do this now. Been long time. (shout mode) People, lunch time!

(everyone pause working & go to lunch)

## Lunch room
Prodeks: (reach chef Massouin), Hey check this out!

Massouin Komahar: Wow! That's a lot of pickles? where did you get one?! Finally!

Prodeks: Hallways beans, I was meant to get bean just for fun but it broke, got this instead.

Massouin: Exquisite! We never have ultimate borgir since months ago! Thank you!

Prodeks: No problem, buddy. get the borgir for us all and you. we've never been have Ultimate Borgir since long.

Massouin: Right away, sir!

## Subrealm
*A Field guard A*: (draw giant laser cannon), goodbye low qualities. (fire)!

(on the other hand)

*Arch enemy*: (draw magic towards some sub-realms), (mess around spell)!!

## go back to command center
Wenak: Ah, that was the best borgir (saw monitor) I've ever.. **WHAT THE??!!** Oh no!, (panik).. What to do, uh (attempt send message).. No that's (saw announcement mic on commander table near giant screen).. hO! (haste into the mic, press talk) Ahei hello! Wenak speaking, we got situation, (saw press broadcast, broadcast to lunch room).. 

*everyone*: (saw, & quickly haste to the command center)!!!

Gyouter: (smashed first into the command center room)!!!, Everyone on your desk! whoa thancc for telling us.

Wenak: What do we have to do?

Gyouter: Check our contract spot.

Grevor: (checked the [contract spot](https://gamebanana.com/mods/293257 )) It's safe. nothing happens.

Latsufir: Sir, um.. our friend got [hacked](https://gamebanana.com/members/1764067 ). The name turns into `Ghost` number number something. And he's banned. (scroll further) uh... `Arch`. hacked by `Arch`, huh..

Nubir Fongyeul: Whoah, many of the creation has been purged in here. Everything has been mess now. Can we do anything?

Gyouter: Well, we gotta figure out who's the terrorist behind this. This gotta be..

Yusekor Umener: Sir, I think we got a [message](https://www.reddit.com/r/FridayNightFunkin/comments/pjns2b/apologies_from_gamebanana/ ) here. Let me show you, (broadcast to giant screen)

Gyouter: (see the message)... The owner.

Nubir: Many people will left right away!

Gyouter: Exactly.

Yusekor: Wow. a moderator went rogue, and... I've seen another source... [damn it](https://gamebanana.com/blogs/19236 ) I've lost it. I heard that was one of the guard that took down our poster.. B is it.. no! it's A!

Nubir: Yes, that was field guard A. him who gave us this freaking *cool and cringe glasses*.

Yusekor: Yes, yes. heh whyn't B as we..

Gyouter: Right, and then anymore other intels regarding to this friend right here? No? well, I think that's it. Hey look, it's [back](https://gamebanana.com/members/1764067 ). back to normal.

Nubir: However, the damage has been done. I have a suggestion here, is to takedown our current spot and join them. Feel free to disagree.

Gyouter: Yes, we [have](https://gamejolt.com/games/last-funkin-moments/634559 ). But for our current [spot](https://gamebanana.com/mods/293257 ), no. **We still need discoveries**.

Nubir: Right, still we gonna use this spot and promote this?

Gyouter: I guess so.. for the time being.

# Investigate the appartment
## still in Wakturia
Grevor: Sir, here it is.

Gyouter: Right so?

Grevor: This is the video I've extracted from my dream last night. This seems like a communication from somebody from what I can tell.

Gyouter: Well, it is. That looks like it, let's see how does it looks like!

## Mysterious dream video
(show floating appartment in space)

Gyouter: Hmmm, that's Io Latahan's appartment. mad scientists live there. uh... What does it mean?

Grevor: Then I hear somekind of a beep, faint beep in a background, then... it sings even faint-more.

Gyouter: (analyzing voice).... Whoah. She again. How did she managed to sneak around Saorfa's dream broadcaster? That room only works with real Saorfas, unless..

Grevor: Indeed! It's **Protoglin Amexamlef** all over again!

Gyouter: This means.. you have to go there. There is something here. Saorfa let her somewhere use the tool and.. You've been chosen.

(video stopped)

Grevor: wow, another The chosone one game again.

Gyouter: (send location link) Alright, great luck. And if you have anything..

## go back out
Polnero Rodin: (press announcement button to Command center), .... (bell finished) Gyouter Embinosa. You presence is awaited in client meeting room 106.

Gyouter: Oh.. Ok, Grevor, that's the location.

Polnero Rodin: And Grevor Sritowi, room 106. yea. (press announcement button again to close).

Gyouter: Alright.. I guess that was important. C'mon, let's go!

Grevor: Neshim, Tengsing?

Neshim M'neer: Right, great luck bro!

Tengsing Pusingson: and God Bless You!

## room 106.
Kofor Mul: Mister, Gyouter, Grevor.

Io Latahan (ee oh lah tah han): Hey buddy wassup?

Gyouter: Io? whoah, it's been a long time. didn't expect to see you here now. How have you been? me is cool and good.

Io: yeah I am cool and good too. whoahow, this place is huge. I am easily lost here so yeah luckily there's a front desk.

Gyouter: Okay uh.. alright. Looks this is kinda a coincidence, so here, my buddy here wanted to go your appartment to investigate something.

Io: Oh really?

Grevor: I saw a strange appartment in my dream last night, I've extracted it and turns out it was your appartment according to him.

Gyouter: yeah, we never have a weird dream at all yestertime. Just..., him got it now.

Io: Huh, okay. that's weird.

Grevor: (show phone and play that dream video file) so um... there's a faint girl voice beep and then singing. Do you know this is?

Io: (listen closely).... No pecking way (immediately pause and press go back)!

Gyouter: Whoa, relax. Sorry, uh...

Io: No no. I just wanna check. (head left), (head right).... do you have `POTASSIUM`?

Gyouter: huh, is that a code, no code but chemical, or banana?

Io: HAAH! uh... did you do something with that pesky subrealm full of cringe effects?

Gyouter: uh cringe.. wa

Io: TRASH, WITHHOLD, EVIL T...

Gyouter: Oh yess! ... we are doing something there. (please don't insult him, he is a nice guy even the mods are not at all)

Io: OK no. don't tell the name.

Grevor: hmmü§î.

Gyouter: ... Do you know `Protoglin Amexamlef`

Io: OOOOoh! I think I do.... nvm, uh what is that?

Gyouter: our codename for the things to consider in our contract right now. It's about her.

Io: Her. you mean?

Gyouter: So, what do need help for?

Io: Ah yes sorry I forgot. AHEM!! I have a problem. It was appartment 3070. Idk, I think it was... months ago but still this year... May if not wrong

Gyouter & Grevor: (sit immediately as they got intrigued with that new intel for Protoglin Amexamlef likely)!

Io: (saw them sit)... (continue) um and uh. I've never heard her like uh idk how to say this.

Gyouter: So you want us to crack it open and look for something. Why? isn't it better be left there who know she came back.

Io: Ah man, I hate to say this. I believe she's **dead** now! Maybe take out the stuff and send it to heaven so she can do more experiment of... teleport here, teleport there, haunt anybody, `Is this working? HAHA! YESS!! THE TRANSITION WORKS` BLA BLa bla, all in angel form now. idk.

Gyouter: (That's it. that's Protoglin Amexamlef!! ü§Øü§Øü§Øü§Ø) Okay.. if that's what you want, we'll take the lockpick arsenal then, and bring it there. How secure is it?

Io: That's another reason I ask you! I've been trying to lockpick her door, to no avail. I've paid over 300000 Kivrontz to get 15 different master lockpicker, still failed. luckily they glad to refund 100% all of them I hired.

Grevor: relieve. What's the brand for the secure door handle?

Io: QWERQY.

Grevor: (Sigh)!!! damn it. Did she integrate that handle to everything when she installed it?

Io: I saw it 5 years ago, she did. all secure.

Grevor: Okay.. I see. Well I think I should take a look at it. Don't worry, we'll try our best to open it up.

Io: Okay, please, take all my 300000 Kvz. I root for your luck.

Gyouter: Woah, thancc for the tip.

Io: wait, tip? OH!! I forgot!! haha lmao!!! You guys work for the Time government, I forgot!! haha

Gyouter: Yeah no need to insist, and yeah these days people still... wait, only Dasandim has Universal Basic Income. lol!

Io: so, we should go.

Grevor: Alright, lemme acquire the lock pick ultimate set.

## Io's appartment, 30th floor, 3070 front door
Io: Here it is. the worst lock ever for thief. Impossible to break.

Gyouter: (saw a lot of bruises by former lockpickers brutforces) wow, indeed. brute forcing is silly idea.

Grevor: (figured out that QWERQY is impossibly securest model) And yeah, you are not kidding. I pecking hate this lock as a lockpicker. love it on my house though. There is no keyhole, immune to magnets, nuclears, and anything. And (scanned material) the proprietary / in-house bedrock material. The door too as well. Wow idk what's in her mind with all this.

Io: She doesn't talk to anyone but herself, rumor says she likes crazy and weird things. Yeah, a typical mad scientists. But idk how mad she is amongst other mad scientists, because her door is the closest of all. rare to see mad scientist that are shy in this appartment.

Grevor: hmm.. I know! Integrated everything. I remember! Door Security Regulation 17, Handle shall only works if safety sensors are all integrated. Door Security Regulation 18, Any response to such safety emmergency issue shall unlocks no matter what. Yeah quite a big risk and awry but idk. Now with this, we can attempt to trigger something emergency virtually here.

Io: There's a fire sensors on every appartment roofs, even inside each cell.

Grevor: Great! now then (take out Pulse heater) I can try to heat that fire detector remotely.

Io: wow, looks like we have to temporarily disable fire alarm for a sec. ugh.. I hate this. This is gonna be the first time I became bad guy.

Gyouter: Oh, Yeah.. but

Io: No, it's okay. I'm afraid she has been rotting inside! so... (take out phone), (press and hold anouncement) Your attention please. All mad scientists, please cease any of your experiements that involves pyrotechnique for there is critical maintenance right now... until I announce back. Thank you (release button), and (go to test setting, disable fire outwild detection). Okay, you guys are good to go.

Grevor: Alright, ... here we go (draw Pulse heater gun, aim to about roof inside), (set to 100 deg C), (fire)! Whoah, the wall and everything is bedrock too, okay (set to 500 C)..

(door handle unlocks)

Grevor: Oh man (quickly release trigger)!

Gyouter: Whoa we did it!

Grevor: ... (open door)! (enter)

Io: (get closer to the door)

Gyouter: (also enter)!

Grevor: Okay, so..

(snow sprinkler turns on)!!

Grevor & Gyouter: (gasp) huoh!!!

Grevor: Oh... yeah, I heated it up.

Io: Wow, she had a snow sprinkler. She didn't tell me.

Grevor: (saw a glowing pod)... whoa, if it isn't.

Io: (look too) Oh. well, she's not here. She must be stuck, and killed.

Grevor: Wait, uh there's a laptop connected to that teleporter. let's have a look! (examine display) Oh my God, Windows 10, what the hell? using earth's elitist operating system lol?

Io: That's unusual. most residents here uses Unix. Wow, the only scientist using what is it? `Windows ten`?

Grevor: Windows 10. surprisingly it didn't restart by itself especially by the release of Windows 11. She must've figured out how to conquer pesky Windows Update restarts somehow.. (look at the interface app).. Okay so this is the app of the teleporter. The log here.

```

Grevor: She went to `White border`. Have any idea about this?

Gyouter: nah, idk.

Io: So, she's trapped in there somehow. been a long time.

Gyouter: I'm pretty much sure she is not dead yet.

Io: Oh, I think I remember, guys! wanna hear some news?

Gyouter: go ahead.

Io: Uh, here, Dyulaba, room 2556. He found spectacular explosion when he was exploring in a dimension void space. and it was quick, poof! and like nothing. He went to the exact spot where it exploded and he found weird piece of paper that says `I've ruined her life :/`. And he was like *huh*? Thankfully he kept it. Here's the photo (show phone and open that photo).

Gyouter: (looked at the photo) Oh, this is interesting. Anything interesting to look, like video

Io: Yes! he, he recorded it. it's in 360 though

Gyouter: okay, lemme see. (look video)... 

Io: Okay (adjust view angle), there where it explode.

Gyouter: ... (found explosion blink) okay stop. (examine)... Oh wait. Does the explosion contains complementary, green swoosh here?

Io: what? I saw just white camera flash like big bang and this weird green swoosh that I don't think supposed to come from there.

Gyouter: Yeah, This has to be Saorfa. They are green, and they're fast. My father often met them back then for some time business like we do now today.

Io: So.. that green swoosh is a Saorfa? oh.. Thancc, so that's how Saorfa looks like.

Gyouter: Yep, this is a Saorfa, they guard the flow of time. and they live outside this dimension here. And... it seems they are retrieving something. Yeah look Saorfa is not treasure hunter, they sometimes saves people though which explains why this green swoosh here.

Io: Wow, there's a lot.

Gyouter: I know, this is complicated, you'll learn it later. btw, is that a white border he looked at?

Io: Oh if I may know, uh... (find other photo of the weird note).. here's the back. take a look (give to Gyouter)

Gyouter: (zoom in).. (read location)..

(suspense timpany sound effect) [`White Border`](https://www.reddit.com/r/DedWebsites/comments/qhijdb/findable_in_archiveorg_wayback_machine_though_3/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3 )

Gyouter: Protoglin Amexamlef?

Grevor: Hold.

Gyouter: Saorfa saved her.

Io: so, you called this `Protoglin Amexamlef`. ok. btw, this is a dangerous mission. You should not ever touch that. these days alot of stuff went bad during this. There's also a multi-dimensional protest going on around here, lots of them are shot dead üóëÔ∏è. no mercy.

Grevor: So, may us take all these stuff off?

Io: ... well, I guess there's no choice. Go, keep it. I believe in you. I think she'll be safe with you along with her stuffs. Great luck, and please save her.

Gyouter: we promise. we'll take great care of everything.

Io: Thank you.

## go back to Wakturia. Vault
Bordim Urum: (close vault door), (lock vault). All clear.

Grevor: Are you sure she's not gonna mad. We've turned off the teleporter here.

Gyouter: Well, hopefully not, after all her destination has been exploded. It's now concluded all this was because of the civil war interdimensionally due to some mishaps by the creator, so no choice that our friend forcedly has to destruct it to help cease it off. Everything is awry, other gamers protested and tried their best to disagree with this. I believe, Kaorfa also depressed hearing this. Hope he fine.

Grevor: Right, this contract has already went radioactive. I fear those field guard came here just to figure out that we're doing this and trash it all out. I wanna save her, but at the same time, talking this, endangers our universe. I suggest we do something else and hand over this to Kaorfa.

Gyouter: Yeah. But unfortunately, Kaorfa has even lost all choices. We all now left with petrification state, for good. ... Most importantly, Our job here to keep the contract going well until the Full Ass.

Grevor: Yeah.

Gyouter: And oh, it's time for vacation. (turn back) Now that should be something else we can do there.

## Command Center
(everyone tidying)...

Beff End: Sir?

Gyouter: (salute hi)! Okay, people. Great job (clap hold) all of you. Didn't felt we now have reached the time for us to go vacation. So, feel free to do anything you want, even go home to your home planet. Just make sure you guys don't jeopardize our contract especially regarding to (point to the right side of the command center where vault is)... Protoglin Amexamlef, don't, don't let anyone hear this, Field guard can be anywhere and also toxic kids too. I get it. We are cry baby wants it back and insist. But again, It's Kaorfa, and we do not question. any question? No? okay. Great luck, and God Bless you.

Beff: Oh yeah! when we'll come back?

Gyouter: Not yet defnined, so always respond to the notification ring on your phone whenever here. This also gets you email and net call & voicemail from Wakturia, so you should not miss that. ... Alright, class dimissed (everyone depart) and God Bless you.

# Ending the season 1
## Front yard
(everyone leaving the office, walking over)

Neshim: Wow, I should see my family now.

Tengsing: Me too. See you around.

Neshim: btw, I've seen a news in here (share link nearby) there was a bunch of incoming what appears like somekind of sub-soul or something, but still not confirmed what it actually is. What do you think?

Tengsing: Hopefully they are good. Perhaps they're lost spirit, needs a new home.

Neshim: Yea. According to data here, the composition of the spirit detected is concluded to match the type as a Pixar's emotion. Whoa, that's weird. isn't that, um isn't they supposedly live only inside the vessel for the rest of their life? How did this happen?, hmm ü§î.. And oh! they also confirm that the origin universe was came from Disney or any universe that belongs to them.

Tengsing: I've heard Marvel Cinematic Universe currently had timeline entanglements issue. Maybe that explains it.

Neshim: Okay, so yeah it is.

Nubir: Bro, what's the matter? you sad?

Latsufir Umnaga: No, but I feel lonely. I have no idea how to describe this (send diagnostic telephatically)

Nubir: (cannot discern the lonely feeling) hmm, But C'mon man! I got you bro, you got family here! we can cover you now.

Latsufir: Idk, I think I missed something.

Nubir: Nah man! you're the best. You asked a lot of question, that's great. The world needs idea, and you're the example for it.

Latsufir: I know. I got a lot here. But no matter what, I still feel alone.

Nubir: hmm, maybe you need girfriend! You've never been thinking about it!, so it's time!

Latsufir: Yeah but uh (look around female employees walking).. I can't find any around here that interests me. I think I have simp deficiency.

Nubir: Don't say that man, maybe they're not yours, there's alot of them in wild. We will get one for you soon.

Latsufir: thancc man.

Yusekor: (calling hotel) Hey, can you please setup the signature DJ? 

Porb Mallun (call): It's ready sir.

Yusekor: Yea? Oh that's great! Right, Now I should get there now and enjoy with my family yeay!
