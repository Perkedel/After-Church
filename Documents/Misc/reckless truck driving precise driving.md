# Reckless truck driving

Precise Driving special level

- Turn right from too tight right instead spacing left, damaging and collision property on your right
- go too fast above 50 Km/h
- in 500m Sudden brake hard now. You must stop exactly by the murderable target on your right. The enough momentum launches a rock trebuchet & releases wood log cargo to the right, crushing the target on right.
- continue for another 500m
- crash as many as minivans running alongside
- crash the wall to finish.
