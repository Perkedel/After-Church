Now. As you can see that, you have been subscribed to a mods that had file names the same as the other mods. That's right.

So, all you have to do to figure out, notice in that file path, between [i]content[i] and [i]CookedPC[/i], there are 2 numbers. On the left is this game's workshop ID, and the right is the mod ID. Now copy the path again, remove everything [b]except the right number[/b]. open one of the mod page, say..

[b]https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2184689743[/b] this e.g. . you click that address bar, take off the number at the end. if you had extra stuffs, delete the extra stuff, it should ends up like this

[b]https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=[/b] Don't press enter yet! recopy the number again so you go to those offending mods. Now you can unsubscribe.

Okay, I'd be better list them all you said here

AW SHUCK!! IT CONFLICT & CRASH THE GAME.
pls avoid naming the file name just [b]Stickers.u[/b] as it will conflict with many mods! Either rename to anything else OR append/prepend with random word stuffs

# stickers (translate to spain)
(Google Translate)
¡AW CIERTO! CONFLICTO Y BLOQUEO DEL JUEGO.
¡Por favor, evite nombrar el nombre del archivo solo [b]Stickers.u[/b] ya que entrará en conflicto con muchas modificaciones! Cambie el nombre a cualquier otra cosa O agregue / anteponga palabras al azar

# refuse rename for intentional reason
okay. I was dealing with so many mod conflicts currently. idk if this particular conflict crash the game, maybe coming back later to test again.
