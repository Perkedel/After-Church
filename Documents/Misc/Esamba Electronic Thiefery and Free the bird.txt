Himso: it is treated as fixing. because we are unable to charge the PC without making it explode.
Nash: I just used general charging. The Galium Nitride Based Charger, Oh I left it. Damn.
Himso: the earth charging must be smarter than ours.
nash: really? I thought.. oh, Thank God the stereotype E.T. (human is more stupid than alien who is much more spohisticated in biology and much smarter) is a hoax!
