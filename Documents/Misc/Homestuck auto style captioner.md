## Begin

Quinzor: Hi. I'm Quinzor. You know that caption is essential for everyone to understand what the speaker was saying. Like (point to the subtitle) you see here, All needs to know. Whether you missed their word, or you have listening difficulties. But then, what's the matter? (look towards the trolls)

Jokinever: Vriska!

Vriska: (read prompt) buu baa bee buu, (noticed subtitle did not follow her writing style) (not on script) hey where's my style? buhhh, buhh..

Jokinever: Terezi!

Terezi: (read) Head's up, brawl, Dance, (noticed also) ummm guys?

Jokinever: & Nepeta!

Nepeta: mi mi mi mimi-mi meow.. oh no!

Quinzor: As you can see, we are so lazy to type that in, Whatever speaker just said. Not to mention the robot. They can only hear so much. And further not to mention, that these talents we have have their own writing style, how could we respect that if the robot does not have any idea?

(switch camera to the right, Note that in audience view, it's from the left angled)

Quinzor: Well, Now there's solution. <span style='color:cyan;background-color:rgba(0,0,0,.25)'>Turn it on, and now the robot is way smarter, more diligent than every manual hand captioner existed.</span> (look back to trolls again & hand soft point to them) <span style='color:cyan;background-color:rgba(0,0,0,.25)'>Check this out!</span>
