# Desert
There is a Desert. In that desolate dessert, there are wife and husband. They have children. 3. 1 son the first & 2 daughter rest of them. And they're bright. Wife and husband work.

# Renovated
Smeckel Mendhi (architect): Okay, guys. what do you think?

Jmersen Helauye (husband): hmm, not bad.

Liya Emarye (wife): Wow!!! Nice!!!

Smeckel: Thanks. Call me if you need me again.

Liya: No problem!

Jmersen: Liya, are you sure about this? we paid so much. 1000 Kivrontz? are you sure?

Liya: I am sure! This is the right investment!

Jmersen: Ah, men. We spent a lot, a loss a lot.

Liya: Who said lost a lot? C'mon! we need this big for our future grandchildren!

Jmerson: Oh my God. Whatever. anyway..

# Interior
Liya: Alright! things ready. Let's clean all of those stuffs!

Jmerson: Liya, careful, I might need some of these thing.

Liya: No I don't think so, yet these items are all obsolete. We should invest new version!

Jmerson: Invest new version? Wait, those items are expensive. You can't recklessly spent a lot more to those items, yet I think these ones are still working mint condition!

Liya: Jmerson. We have to think new! A newer world! newer is better! much better! And also we already had too kivrontz here in our hand, yet that also because of last months Airdrop.

(Bank of Kivrontz)
Herjo Nadamin: Did you just made your crypto wallet when the airdrop has over?

Kento Samarto: Yes, I just immigrated here and heard last month there already an airdrop. What the f888? I am late?!

Herjo: don't worry, everyone here in Dasandim and outside who had Kivrontz wallet gets airdrop. here's your airdrop.

(Get 60 Million Kivrontz)

Kento: **WOW!!! SIXTY MILLION KIVRONTZ!!!** NO WAY!!! I MUST AND I WILL DIE HERE!!! (This is appreciation to Dasandim government. Because this airdrop, he suddenly became loyal to Dasandim and disloyal Earth)

(Back again)
Jmerson: ummm yeah. but, We can't Foya-foya (wasting money) just like that. We need to collect them, for our grandchildren!

Liya: Well, if you keep money for generations, when they all will enjoy life? Not possible with that. Life is not about money, it's happiness that we should benefit!

Jmerson: Agh, I don't get it. whatever you say.

# Cleaning
Liya: Jmerson, Kolep, Masya, Tasye! Come here!

Kolep Emaurye: Coming mom!

Masya Emaurye: Yes mom!

Tasye Emaurye: wait mom!

Liya: alright, guys. Which one you no longer use?

Kolep: What? you want me to throw these away?

Liya: Yeah, these items are old. nobody using this anymore today.

Kolep: wait, I think this is still useful here.

Jmerson: Yeah could be useful.

Liya: Son, this item here had a new version. check Toko.

Kolep: (open online shopping app Toko) Ok hold on... Wow! really?! New version!!! **YESS!!** Add to cart, buy!!! wait, let me take the SD card off (take off SD card). HAHA YESS!! now give it to someone!

Jmerson: Liya? what did you do? you let him throw his items away?

Liya: well, that's what he wants.

Jmerson: wait. Are you sure this is correct? that game console cost 19000 Kivrontz! Previously this once it cost only 5000 Kiblontz (Physical Money). What are you doing?!

Liya: Dear, I know you are devastated. but we got to upgrade our house, as well as cleaning some unused items so it clean!

(show junks with flies around it for 5 seconds)

(back again)

Jmerson: Sigh, you just want me to throw my precious stuffs, wouldn't you?

Masya: Whoah! language! watch your mouth! **This is not gutter mouth convention!**

Jmerson: I'm sorry, I swore, but this is infuriating already, can't we just add another warehouse here somewhere?

Tasye (she is shy and purple): (checked Toko but unfortunately not found great warehouse architect to hire) ummm, uhhh... uh... bad news. the personal warehouse architect is closed permanently. We got only self-build kit which is smaller.

Liya: Forget about it. we will purge these all, and soon we'll pretty forget about it and never remember if not touched.

(someone's house. A gamer)
Gesterin Nedemi: (concentrating on a video game and streaming) Okay guys, I just slain that guy. Left one more to get me ranked!.. (won) **YESS!!!** FINALLY!!! Ranked up, guys. woohoo!

Schmimonad Utodar: (come to Gesterin's gaming room). Gesterin?

Gesterin: Oh hey! I just won and ranked up. what a coincidence.

Schmimonad: Congratulations! btw, I found this strange landscape PDA thingy in your back stash.

Gesterin: (take the ancient GPS) hmm? OH!!! This. I remember this. This, is a Global Positioning System Unit Device, simply called GPS. And lucky me, this had everything that PDA does, because this is basically a PDA, sometimes called landscape PDA. Ahhhh, what a good time. I modded this thing to play pretty much every games, last one I remember was... Oh, it's a Steam game, it's Henry Stickmin game if I not forget. Yeah, this is not so powerful device, but it could run Henry Stickmin, magic. So yeah. I found out this thing is preinstalled with Linux, Debian based OS, so porting everything to this thing is not that difficult, just [Wine](http://winehq.org/ ) it and done. Unfortunately, this is the latest model before premature discontinuation, because, Earth people doesn't familiar with Linux Desktop sadly even Kickstarter & Indiegogo success. And after that company immigrated to Dasandim which turns out are familiar with 100% Linux Desktop, they went chemistry instead of still technology. Yeah, what uh... pessimistic founder. He quickly lost hope. That's really stupid.

Schmimonad: What should I do with this?

Gesterin: ummm, just museum it. give it to Archive Alliance, I hate weak device. Wait, let me take the SD card off 1st.. (take of SD card).

Schimonad: And, don't you want to format this? this contains your password in.

Gesterin: Ah simple! just push this hole for 20 second.

... 20 second

...

...

Gesterin: done. Device Reset to Factory.

Skamatu PDA: Welcome, to Skamatu World! Enter your Name.

Gesterin: Go ahead, now give it to Archive Alliance. I don't need Kivrontz for that.

Schimonad: Okay, sir. I'm giving this. (turn off GPS PDA)

Skamatu PDA: Goodbye, See you later! (off)

Gesterin: Oh yeah, the GPS talks. I think I still have that same software installed (check [Synaptic](https://itsfoss.com/synaptic-package-manager/ ) and search that talkative module package), Oh my God! I still have that?! owh, I've long time disabled it. that was annoying experience. I think I should remove this than it eating my disk.

(back again)
Jmerson: ..., sigh.. (stand up and leave place)

# Hoarding
(in a hangout cafe)

Jnek Tarhon: So, do you want these electronics?

Jmerson: Cool! I need this Battery Backup for my Node Router here!

Jnek Tarhon: and about this Fass Printer?

Jmerson: Cool! I think I need to print somehow.

Yester the CCC employee: Idiot! nobody is printing paper in Dasandim anymore!

Jnek Tarhon: Well take it. it's free!

Jmerson: Yess!

(go home)

Jmerson: Son! I got you new electronics!

Kolep: Wow cool! let me see!

Jmerson: Here they are! Battery Backup & Fass Printer!

Kolep: uh.. okay. let me run this Backup Battery. (connect to power outlet). Okay, here we go. (turn on). ... ... ... uh, it doesn't work?

Jmerson: doesn't work? okay I should fix that. how about the printer?

Kolep: (take a USB-B the Printer cable from drawer), (connect B end to printer), (connect A end to computer). Oh wait! the power! (connect printer power input to power outlet).

Fass Printer: (turns on). (Diagnosing)... ... ... (Yellow Toner Light).

Kolep: Out of toner.

Jmerson: Okay, I'm just gonna find the toner for it.

Kolep: You wish. nobody is printing with paper in Dasandim. Everyone here is digital. Oh, wait. I know. there's an Old City in Dasandim. and you should go to Zero District for 90s to early 2000s item. sure, there is even Printer Toner Factory still open to this day.

Jmerson: (see Toko with search of Printer Toner). Oh my God. that's expensive. all toners cost me 500 Kivrontz?! Ah delusional guys.

Kolep: Hey, language! Physical Printing things are things in a past and only dedicated fans talks about it. it's just, a novelty show nowadays since long ago.

Jmerson: ugh..

Masya: Mommy! daddy is collecting junk again!

Jmerson: **MASYA!!!** No!

Liya: What's going on?! (arrive and busted Jmerson)! Jmerson?!

Jmerson: Wait, I can explain.

Kolep: UH, the Battery Backup is broken, and Dasandim normally doesn't print with paper.

Jmerson: **SON!!!?** naughty boy.

Liya: Alright. Let me be serious.

Jmerson: WAIT! I can fix this. give me sometime to fix these.

Liya: Okay, if in 3 days this not fix, I'll incenerate them without your notice.

Jmerson: What did you say? I just got them for free, you know.

Liya: I think, you are bamboozled. that's why. You shall not be silly.

Jmerson: silly what? it's bargain!

Liya: You have been idiotized! Jnek likes to fool you, because you just accept without clarifying its condition 1st!

Jmerson: Liya? What do you mean? I do need all these to make our home good.

Liya: You are not allowed to take used item, especially for free like Jnek. Look this Battery Backup here nowadays are so small yet still powerful, and houses currently being installed more with Powerbanks a house.

(someone's house in another desolate place with Powerbank a house technology)

Smeckel: Okay. what do you think with the look of this Giant Powerbank?

Kantar Andesit: Amazing! now my house looks like spaceship! **Bye-bye Relying only on AC-power!!**

(back again)

Jmerson: Okay, I get it. but that cost me as much as 40000 Kivrontz!

(Kolep mentally shocked, the drama is at it again)

Liya: And this? what is this? you want to generate garbage?

Jmerson: Hey, my friend need to see things in paper.

Liya: Oh yeah? I'm sorry, Dasandimian hospital managed to remove Sketel's cancer already and fixed his gene to prevent such thing from happening again for good, now he can live happy in front of gaming PC eternally.

Jmerson: I didn't know that. maybe some other will need?
