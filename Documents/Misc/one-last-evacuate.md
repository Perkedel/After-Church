## Tobol Recovery Post, Tobol planet.
Captain Tacksel Ontarapotin: (walk left & right)..., ...., ...

Sky: (portal to inside the Post garage)!, (walk the car in)..

Tacksel: Oh well.. (check ground level, go downstair from control office)... Okay! They came!

Latsufir Umnaga: (Open window)... So, is this the place?

Tacksel: Yes, correct. Hi. My name is Tacksel, captain Tacksel. I'm here in charge for this mission.

Latsufir: Alright,.. Captain.. Tacksel. Yess. So, what do gonna do here?

Tacksel: Tonight, (show tablet PC opened the mission file) we have to rescue this one last guy.

Latsufir: (examine content)..

Tacksel: Easy, you go straight for about 72 Km from here. Let me show you (go upstair to control office)

Latsufir: (follow)

Sky: (follow)

Tacksel: So, (set coordinate to aim electric telescope towards Dopan's house).. he will be on this house, (zoom in) just.. (zoom in) straight over there.

Dopan Konliyok: (noticed being spotted)?? (get out of house), (wave beg rescue jump pose)!!!!

Tacksel: Ha, (async) see that? that's him. he's the only guy.

Latsufir: (async) oh!

Dopan: (out of breath asthma)!!, (cough) euhook!! uhuk!! (get inside immediately)!!

Tacksel: We gotta be quick. Out there the air is running out. He'll be dead by the next morning if we don't go now. Then followed by us 2 weeks later because look (point at oxygen meter), In here this has been presurized. Air out there is.. unbreathable. anymore.

Latsufir: Okay then. Go straight there?

Tacksel: Yess. Wait into the presure buffer chamber, and go. just... go straight. and then go to (point to the other end of garage) there, everyone must be washed after mission.

Latsufir: Oh wow.

Tacksel: I know. Trust me, this is for the last. We can't screw this up anymore.

Latsufir: Okay then. Question is, why you are the only here?

Tacksel: Everyone has to leave. I've risked too many.

Latsufir: Well, can't you just used remote car?

Tacksel: Good question but.. uhh (embarrasedly look at window full of polution military car)..

Latsufir: Oh, what's with the car?

Tacksel: It's not broken but.. uh.. Tobol's the only Military car. all ice.

Latsufir: Oh, Internal Combustion Engine. Well..

Tacksel: I know, not just irony, but uh.. we must travel with this (show the air barrier module puck). This is Air Barrier. (turn on), It is 360 degree umbrella protecting against tar. Yeah, now the air contains tar, you see that? You don't want to breath that air at all, so all soldier must equip this in their car.

Latsufir: Okay, that's great! But what's wrong?

Tacksel: Funny things.. because we cannot adjust the field diameter, it can only oval capsule, and we even tried to elongate the... exhaust pipe beyond the diameter, uh, turns out it's not the pipe that pierces the bubble constanly, everywhere around the engine and air conditioner. If we too long travel here, we'll suffocate, inside the bubble. Turn this off, you'll be instantly fulfilling your lung with tar. Wuuuuegh!! scary!

Latsufir: So, you asked us here because we're the only one to have an EV?

Tacksel: Exactly. You're the only one, yeah one of them. Still too few. I just heard you are some few of the Dasandimian that started adapting a car. I am very surprised you Dasandimian doesn't have car. How do you guys travel back then?

Latsufir: With... underground commutes.. of course..

Tacksel: Ah that's right. Subways. and for feet, with shoe feet?

Latsufir: Kayuh bikes sometimes.

Tacksel: Okay, I thought.. anyway. We gotta be quick here, now it's... 6 PM. alright, (give new package of puke bags) Here's the puke bags, we have been breathing tar for 15 years, so give him puke it up.., 2 of these, gas mask..., and of course, (give Air Barrier module puck) the barrier. Attach this to your car. Now, (go to control panel)! We do this now. Go!

Latsufir: (go back to car), (attach seatbelt)

Sky: (go back to car), (turn on car), (twist shifter stock full to `D`), oh, (attach seatbelt). 

Tacksel: Okay, wait inside the chamber, (open first hatch). Now.

Sky: (go to presurize balance chamber)..

Tacksel: (close first hatch), Now, Turn on the module!

(360 camera activates)

Latsufir: (examine) okay how (rotate around) do I.. There's a magnet. Neodymium magnet. Okay, (give to Sky) Sky?

Sky: (take the puck), (attach to the deceivingly not speaker magnetic pad next to cluster)!

(module turns on)!!

Latsufir: Oh wow!

Tacksel: Alright, it's on, opening the tar air.. (equalize pressure to outside)!

(pressure balancing)!...

Latsufir: (nervous) Right, Here we go.

Sky: (nervous) hokey..

Latsufir: Don't be afraid Sky. God is here to protect us.

Tacksel: Okay, opening the second gate.. uhhh (open second gate)..

(2nd gate opens)!......

Tacksel: Alright, you go now. We have only until 1 AM, possibly.

Sky: (swallow spit).. (gas pedal)..

## Kongsiong Street
...

...

(360 camera deactivates automatically)

Latsufir: Okay, just this path, the house should be veery visible.

Tacksel: (through wireless voice chat) Yess.

Latsufir: Right. Test of faith.

(car is in Eco mode, full pedal)
...

...

...

Latsufir: (examining around).... Wow, Where's everybody here?

Tacksel: We've rescued all of them in the middle of all calamaties I've had mentioned over the past 12 years ever since the polution gone up bad. He's the last one.

Latsufir: Okay..

Tacksel: ... Btw, you notice there are lack of tree around you. Kongsiong is originally forest. But yeah you know, those b88888 cut them all off without replanting single one.

Latsufir: Ouch, man.

Tacksel: Eh, I wish the fairies don't have to sign that. Now, the fairies have called us here, to fix their mistake. Despite we now live in a space island called Beanstalk City, there's still alot of people stuck in the old planet.

Latsufir: Oh, Beanstalk City? that was you?

Tacksel: Yeah. that's where the fairies now live.

Latsufir: Oh wow! We confirmed have fairies in Dasandim!! My dad's correct!

Tacksel: That's right. It was a viral story back in 1999. We planted 1 seed, for the better future. Ever there an argument, Dasandim hates heighted house, except commercial offices.

Latsufir: Yess, because habitants can fall damage of any type. Maximum 3 level to up, but going down, can be any number. We Dasandim loves to dig.

Tacksel: Yeah. Thankfully though, they made us exception, as long we promise that noone abuses fall damage over the past anytime, and make sure the beanstalk peak is through the space, so the gravity is not much significant. Also around the Beanstalk, we have galaxy's most giant trampoline.

Latsufir: Ah yess! so to cancel the damage if they just wanna fall. Okay! Yeah..

Tacksel: You ever visited that?

Latsufir: No, never yet. My planet is so big, my dad couldn't cover the entire planet that fast. He also has job too.

Tacksel: Well, you got a great luck here. coz after this, you'll bring him back to his new home at, Beanstalk City.

Latsufir: OH!! Yess!!!

Tacksel: Yeah. You would bring your family here.

Latsufir: Alright, okeh..

...

...

Tacksel: Hey, you're almost there. On your left!

Latsufir: (looking the house on left) Huh? Sky?

Sky: Okay!

Tacksel: Alright that's it. He gonna out (async).., stop.

Sky: (async) (slow down by lift pedal a bit)... (stop by the house, release gas pedal, just rely I-Pedal)!

Tacksel: Okay. Dopan?

Dopan: ... (get out from house)...

Sky: (press unlock all door).

(camera show protruding door handle & go back again)

Latsufir: Alright..

Dopan: (swivel around back)..

Latsufir: Whoah, dude.. you can just...

Tacksel: 😐...

Dopan: (attempt to go to right back door), (lung blocked by the Air Barrier)!? ahak!

Sky: Lats? I think he got stuck.

Latsufir: Oh, that's right! (overequip gas mask on top of N95 currently equiped)!, (take one new puke bag), (teleport to back right)!!

Tacksel: Okay, now do the extraction maneuver. Dopan had learnt it. He gonna bow, grab his shoulder, on 123, pull.

Latsufir: Okay?

Dopan: (bow), (point to shoulder to say `pull me`)! ! !..

Latsufir: (grab both shoulder) Shoulder?

Dopan: (take the puke bag & hold both handles with each hand), (open and put upon the mouth). (async) (butt push signal 1), (2), ..., (🤮puke to the bag)!

Latsufir: (async) Oh okay, 1, 2, ready, GO! (pull hardest using Air Barrier field to push the tar out)!!!

Dopan: 🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮EUUUAAAAUAUAUAUUAHAEEAEAAEA..

Latsufir: Yess yess, keep going..

Dopan: 🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮...

Tacksel: 😐 (worried face)....

Dopan: 🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮...

...

...

Tacksel: Oh my God, this guy has been? uh.. 5 years..

Dopan: 🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮 AAAAAAAAHHHHHEH EHEE EHEH... (cough hard) EUHEUK!!! WUUUEHHHUEUWQ!!, Agh... 🤢🤢🤢🤢,

Latsufir: Oh, whoah..

Dopan: (puke blood) 🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮!!!! (finally got inside the air barrier, except the tar filled puke bag which he still held) HAAAAGH.. hoogh!.. (async) (give to Latsufir) Thanks, man. (lean towards right back window).. 

Latsufir: (async) Oh (take the filled bag).. ... Okay, no problem.

Dopan: (open back right door), (get in), (close door), (fell lie sideways on the seat)! Aaaaghhhhhhh...

Latsufir: Alright, What do I gonna do with this?

Tacksel: Just drop it!

Latsufir: NO! I don't want to recklessly throw this. This is biohazard here! (look to back right and found 2 wheeled trash can) Okay, wait. (pull the bag inside), (failed because tar is blocked)!? Whoah? oh, umm (attempt to circumference around the back of the field into the left side of the field)..

Tacksel: (saw that Latsufir has to walk way long over the unused space since IONIQ 5 is short lengthed compared to the bus-like military car) Oh yeah, the field was designed for longer car, I'm sorry but we have to quickly issue the shield, no time.

Latsufir: It's okay.. (reaching the trash can)... (arrived to the trash can) Right. (left hand open cover), (right hand throw the bag into trash can)!, (slowly close cover to prevent more toxin fly everywhere)... Ah. Okay. ... (left hand fast pull into inside barrier) UGH!!! (clean kinetically), ... (right hand fast pull into inside barrier) AAGH!! (clean kinetically), Okay cool and good. (go to left front door)... (open left front door),

Sky: (draw the sanitizer spray)..

Latsufir: (right foot fast lift) HEAGh! (put right foot to the car floor), (fast jump into the seat & sitt) IYAH!!

Sky: (spray Latsufir)!!.....

Latsufir: (lift hands to let the sanitizing liquid cover entire body)..

Sky: (and to the legs)... (stop), (spray Dopan)!!.......... (stop) Okay.

Latsufir: (close door)!, Alright, let's go. So, back at the post?

Tacksel: Yap, wait, no need teleport. Let me just do that. (spawn teleporter in front of the car, going back to the post at the other end)! There.

Latsufir: Right.

Sky: (go to portal)...

## Tobol Recovery Post again.

Tacksel: Alright, good. get into this door.

Sky: (go into equializing chamber)... (stop).

(360 camera actives again)!

Tacksel: Okay, (equalize & sterilize air for inside)!

(equalizing pressure to inside & clean)!!

Tacksel: Alright, guys. after you landed the vehicle into the spot, get out the car immediately, immediately shower next to you, leave them open, leave the keyfob, everything has to be cleaned.

Latsufir: Yes sir.

(Equalizing complete)!

Tacksel: Okay, park the car into the green spot, align the front with green, and yellow with back..

Sky: (managed to slot both front & back wheel right into the slot satisfyingly)

Tacksel: (saw that the wheelbase length perfectly matches with bus-like military car) Whoah. Okay. put the keyfob on the console,

Sky: (take out keyfob), (put to center console inside the tent next to wireless charging)

Tacksel: get out immediately & shower next to you.

*everyone*: (get out of car & pick shower slot)

Latsufir: (remembered how discomfortful this operation would be) Oh.. This again.

Tacksel: C'mon man. Did you know, virus can stick in your nasal but obviously can be cleaned this way?

Latsufir: I know. fine!

Sky: Wait, how do I?

Latsufir: Don't worry, Sky. (telepathy connect control Sky), Just follow me. (tilt head 45 degrees to right & exclusively breath mouth only),

Latsufir: Hokey, (walk to exit)..

## Go upstair
Latsufir: (upset about second last wash procedure)... Okay, explain this.

Tacksel: I've already explained. I'm sorry, We've uh.. If uh..

Latsufir: Don't do that again, okay?

Tacksel: Yeah. well, this is it. That's all. We're finished. Finally!

Latsufir: Okay, no more?

Tacksel: This is the last one. Now, uh.. (deploy portal to Beanstalk City (ground level), Dasandim at door where start mission), Now, bring him. First lemme check tar.. (scan tar)... Okay, the cigarette smell is gone. For now. Takes time, eventually gone fully. Just leave him in the fresh air of

**Beanstalk City**

Latsufir: Oh wait, Beanstalk City?!

Tacksel: Yep, our new home.

Latsufir: Oh yess!! Really?!

Tacksel: Go ahead.

Latsufir: Sky, let's go!! (go back to car)

Tacksel: (close portal).. Okay, Cargo.. now.

Latsufir: Oh hi?

Dopan: Hey, excuse me.

Doni Konliyok (dad): My boy! (hug)

Dopan: pap? (reply hug)

Latsufir: Okay, cool and good. finally he's back with family.

Gyouter Embinosa: Latsufir! Sky!

Latsufir: (look back) huh?

Sky: (look back) eh?

*both*: came towards

Gyouter: Great job, people.

Latsufir: Oh, Sir?

Gyouter: We heard that Tacksel brought you here at the end. So, here we are.

Latsufir: Yeah. Also got a chance to finally visit this place here. Wow. (look at parents) Whoah, mom, dad?

Crestin Umnaga (dad): Nak?

Latsufir: Eh! (hug dad)... (hug mom)

Bilo (mom): yeah!

Sky: (hug mom & dad)

Yolaine (mom): (reply hug)

Molin Johansen (dad): (reply hug)

Gyouter: So, do you wanted to visit the Beanstalk there?

Latsufir: Oh yess!!! People, let's go! You bring car?

Gyouter: Uh, it's in service.

(show Tesla model X being maintained in schedule at Tesla repair shop at Earth)

Latsufir: aw man, C'mon, come with me!

JOELwindows7: Now how do we fit both parents & Gyouter in the back? let's find out.

Gyouter: Okay. Wait. your car only has 5 seats! h, h.., How do we..

Bilo: I got an idea!

Gyouter: Okay, what is it?

### Seat Configure

|Latsufir| *console island* |Sky|
|Bilo on top of Crestin| Gyouter |Yolaine on top of Molin|
### Let's go
(Yolaine sat on Molin's lap)

Bilo: Okay, now you.

Gyouter: Right.. (enter back left door), (sitt on center back).

Bilo: Crestin.

Crestin: (enter back left & sitt left back) Oke!

Bilo: Alright! (sitt on Crestin lap), (close back left door)! Okey, Jalan!!

Sky: (impressed)!.., Wow, okay. (look front again), (gas pedal).

Latsufir: (also impressed & look front again).., Well I'm sorry we didn't see this one coming. Perhaps we should get more seated car next time. I heard IONIQ 7 would cover this up, idk.

Gyouter: Yeah, hopefully we can get more seated car like that. But also I've heard the prototyping phase for our own EV (which has 7 seats) is going to be ready in couple months and we got to participate, so umm..

Latsufir: idk, we'll see that later.

Gyouter: Yeah. Oh btw, just so you know, despite you can use mechanical steering mode anytime, King Dasan decided that Steer by wire / Digital Steering is default. 

Latsufir: Oh..

Gyouter: um idk, this might sounds..., bizzare. But we have no idea how do we move forward. But hey, At least it's not removed, but uh, the column for mechanical steering mode from what I heard is cable flexible. don't know that would work. Hopefully is.

Latsufir: Yeah. Well, I'm thrilled to see that, so we should evaluate soon.

Gyouter: he em.

Latsufir: Okay, now how do we get up there?

Gyouter: There are 2 lifts. one in underground & another here ground. Just go ahead, that's the station.

Latsufir: Okay. Easy.

## Beanstalk Ground Lift
Sky: Okay, So, enter this gate? (open front right window)

Gyouter: yeah, Okay, hmm, (reach right back power window button) Excuse me, (mistakenly pressed heated seat adjust button)

Molin: Oooh my God, it's hot..

Gyouter: Oh, wait sorry.. (press again & again, until all LED are off)! !. (reposition behind and press down)!

(window back left goes down)

Qwebeng: Heh? Gyouter?

Gyouter: sup.

Qwebeng: Yes, sir. It's free for you. Please wait. (check underneath for bad items).... Okay clear, (open stick portal)!

Gyouter: Thancc.

Qwebeng: No problem sir.

JOELwindows7: this automatic entrance pay is not available yet, it'll be later.

Sky: Let's go (continue to the lift)..

Gyouter: Alright, great! it's empty now.

(lift arrives at ground level), (lift open door)

Sky: (enter lift).. (press `P` on shifter stock), (pull handbrake).

(lift goes up to peak)

## Beanstalk stem
Latsufir: Ah yess. Dad, this is it! What do you think?

Crestin: Wow. It's scary high, But it's worth it. Once in a life you know.

Latsufir: Yep.

Crestin: Look down there! getting smaller! No insult, sorry.

Gyouter: Btw, did you know, the Woods over there are fireproof?

Sky: wait, what?!

Molin: You joking.

Gyouter: We, um the City Planner have created special formula for the trees over there. Both for air, and harvest. Because you know.. Fire is never friend in this case.

Yolaine: Then how do they supposed to heat up?

Gyouter: The major kept the firewood version, and color it red to mark it. Well, that was a decade ago. We have already banned smokeable fire, and replace it with electric heater instead.

Yolaine: Isn't that wasteful?

Gyouter: I know but, smoke recycler system design we know are not only complicated but also clunky. Of course also, it's risky. So, uh we resort to electric heater. But again, temperature here is already ideal most of the time.

Yolaine: Okay. Just concern because I felt cold here.

Gyouter: Yeah, It's basically forest here. You know, idk.

Yolaine: Well, guess I have to begin getting used to it.

Gyouter: Yep.

...

...

...

...

...

(beep almost arrive)

Gyouter: Okay, we're arriving. Wait, wait until stop first..

...

(slowing down)............... (locking platform), (open door)!

Sky: Okay, here's the peak, (push shifter stock clockwise full to `D`), (if handbrake did not disengage, disengange now)... (already disengage), Let's go, (gas pedal).

## Beanstalk Peak
...

...

...

Latsufir: Wow, uh.. It's very empty here!

Gyouter: Yeah, apparently this place was just couple decades ago.. I mean..

Latsufir: No idea, but I think it supposedly already full by this point. But of course,

Gyouter: Height. Dasandimians afraid of height. Fall damage.

Latsufir: I mean, I know it can't be a stayable or livables, only amusements & workforces. But this fraid?

Gyouter: Well, can't deny that fact this place is really tall. I just.. concern, this might be a failed business. Except..

Latsufir: Fairies, you said before.

Gyouter: No, not even fairies here yet. They from beginning already settled on trees, regular heighted trees back then.

Latsufir: Down there, alright. (saw a sushi height view restaurant) Oh look, restaurant.

Gyouter: Yep, to this day, they're the only one. 2008. standing up to this day and tourist (observe far inside)... yeah tourist, who'd like to enjoy height while satisfying hunger bar.

Sky: And I saw charger! Lemme check (check cluster)... Eh whatever, let's fill it up!

Gyouter: Good idea!

Sky: (park the car next to DC fast charger, car behinds the station).... (`P` the car), okay. let's go!

*everyone*: (get out from car)!..

Gyouter: (observe charger)..

Sky: (open back left fuel cap), (take CCS Type 2 plug from station), (plug into the car), Right.. (async) (immediately charge for $0) Oh it's free, wow! (lock car)!

Hyundai IONIQ 5: (async) (Start receiving fast charge) Pengecasan dimulai. ... (locked)!

Gyouter: cool and good. Okay, pople, I think we should walk stroll around here. Just uh.. round this edge. Is okay?

Molin: Eh, It's fine! We should walk, add health.

Gyouter: Alright, let's go.

*everyone*: (start walk stroll)..

...

...

...

Latsufir: So, we hear any plan around this place?

Gyouter: Me too, I don't hear it yet.

...

...

...

Gyouter: You know what, on second thought, we should just tell you interesting things I've ever heard of from the news trend related to here. They said that there is a photon powered booster, I wanna know here.. 🤔 hmmm... Let's find the spot. Shall we?

Sky: I'm curious. Light powered??

Gyouter: (walk there) Yeah, I gotta see it. How this is possible?.. So yeah. (arrived) And there we are. there's that blue.

Sky: (run to the viewing fence)!!

*everyone*: (also walk to the viewing fence)..

Gyouter: Alright, people just relax, (walk to there) I think the light won't turn off, otherwise this entire place will swerve & tilt eventually. So.. (arrive & observe)..

## PhotonPush Viewing Spot
...

...

Gyouter: Yeah. Fascinating. I mean, lots of possible way to uh.. push the platform so it doesn't off the set, but hey.., Fairies makes it.. magical..

Sky: (glisten eyes)....

Latsufir: (confusably impressed)... I.. idk, this..

Gyouter: Yeah. I mean it's just a laser beam, and photon supposedly super light, affects almost zero physically towards air...

Sky: (mind pop a genius idea about installing that PhotonPush inside unused tail Parametric Pixel on her IONIQ 5)!!!, Ahh!, wait wait

Gyouter: What is it?

Sky: Hey, you know that my car?

Gyouter: hu uh..

Sky: In the tail light, there are lots of unused spots. Now., how about to fill those spots with that uh magical booster thingy?

Gyouter: Oh wai wait.

Latsufir: OH! I get it. Fill every unused pixel in back with that magic booster!

Sky: YESS!!!

Gyouter: OOOh, AAh, great idea!! great idea great idea. YESS. ... Um, but idk if that takes lots of energy. But it's cool though! That's should complete the car. Oh yeah of course, make it fly!

Sky: YESS yess yess.

Gyouter: Wow okay. Alright hold on, lemme get article about this (open article about PhotonPush)... Okay. So..

Latsufir: (look Gyouter's phone)

Sky: (also look)

Gyouter: The PhotonPush here, has this crystal here.. if electrified, it'll emit tremendous amount of energy. Okay, just electrify it. Each volt will emit exactly about 200 Joules on a 1 cm diameter without any shroud. Okay, cool. If we shroud it, total energy that emited from the opening will be about 800 Joules with the same size same volt. Wow, alright. Shroud it. That's it. simple! Right, (bookmark the article) saving this. Anything else that your car missed?

Sky: Uh... Keyfob lacks park pusher, lacks the front motor, ..

Gyouter: (found IONIQ 5 Indonesian version lack list) Oh wai wait. I got it. Yeah. here. Dashcam, Digital sideview, etc. yeah. Okay.

...

...

Gyouter: Well I guess there is nothing more in here at the moment.

Crestin: But I saw a restaurant over there.

Gyouter: hmmm (scanning far)?... (it's a sushi restaurant) Okay..

## Deo Sushis
Gyouter: Okay, people. which sushi you wanna have?

Molin: (stop obversation around mode)! wait, now?

Gyouter: Yeah. the menu is digital.

Molin: Oh. (look at screen), (deciding)... uuuuuuuh.....

Bilo: Okay, you know what? How about we choose random sushi types in numbers of us here. Then we'll rearrange all the sushis so we can have each type. (count) one (herself) two (Crestin) (subtotal 2), one (Yolaine) two (Molin) (subtotal 4), uh huh (Sky), eeh hee (Latsufir) (sub total 6), one (Gyouter) (Total 7).. Okay 7 types. 

Gyouter: Wow, okay that's a great idea. Go ahead. People if you feel sus and think it's not favourable, feel free to unselect & reselect different menu again.

Bilo: Okay so..

Chosen:
- California
- Sashimi
- 🦀 Crab Rave

Bilo: wait, Crab? no.

Gyouter: No, we don't want crab. anyone?

Molin: Uh uh.
