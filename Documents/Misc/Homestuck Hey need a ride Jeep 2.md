# Found something in Dieng

Accidentally found one of the mistakenly harrasser tool, a destroyed iPhone 5C with identification tiny card chip.

<!-- but then the high order orders not to prison Ubush because he has something no police has to strain him, told to throw to "Judgement dimmension" which they have no idea and cause little drama. Johan approach and ask what happen, and they said so. Johan told Vriska -->

Tono: Hah, maksudnya gimana Kapten??

Captain Dede Sukorejo: Nggak nggak, jangan! kita gak punya alat untuk menahannya, pokoknya buang ke lapas Judgmental.

Tono: Apaan itu?

Johan: (Noticed, approach)..

Dede: Nanti datang infonya. Pokoknya jerumuskan dia kesitu, orang seperti itu sangat kuat & kita dibuat sama sekali tak tahu menahu.

Info: That's right. Unlike every prison around galaxies, most Harrassers requires magic jammer, which on Earth, even the most sophisticated nation like USA, Japan, Korea, Germany, Swiss, Sweden, or even Estonia, they don't have at all. The Jammer is very expensive. But throwing it to Judgemental dimension is much cheaper provided you got the person to open it up.

Tono: Bentar, cari dulu informasinya, apa maksud kapten soal Judgemental..

Johan: Permisi pak. Ada apa ini?

Tono: Uh... ini Kapten.

Officer Kayib Muhamad: Si kapten melarang untuk memenjarakan terpidana di lapas ini.

Tono: Katanya dia kuat, nanti dia bisa kabur entah gimana.

Johan: Okay, tadi kalian bilang Judgemental.

Tono: Iya, *jerumuskan ke lapas Judgemental*. Bapak ngerti tempat itu?

Johan: Okay. bentar. Vriska!!

Tavros: (pause monitoring Vriska) bENTAR, LAGI ISTIRAHAT, WHAT'S GOING ON?

Johan: Ubush cannot be thrown to this prison coz he escapes somehow, he must be thrown directly to Judgmental. tell her to open up the throwaway chute there!

Tavros: oKAY, HOLD,,

Vriska: (heard) huh.. judgemental?

Tavros: vRIS, WAIT,

Vriska: (flip body), (focus to the position next by the car), (open portal Judgemental dimension)!!

Tono: (portal opens in front of face) Whoahoho..

Johan: Udah, lempar aja.

Tono: ... (throw)!

Ubush: WHOAAAA!!!!

Vriska: (close & fell relax)!!, (reflip lie up).. (take breath), (exhale)...

Tono: Wow... apa itu tadi?

Johan: Oh, cuman portal. Blm pernah lihat ini?

Tono: Nggak..

Johan: Ya begitulah. kami dari Dasandim. kami sedang bertugas sebagai Interpol. Intergalactic Police.

Tono: Whoaow... Maksud kalian.. kalian dari luar angkasa?

Johan: Yap.

Tono: Wow, tp lancar juga Bahasa Indonesia lu. gw kira bakal ngomong kaya ahsjlghaljreeghlhaerg

Johan: Oh nggak, untuk planet kami, nggak, kami ngomong English & Bahasa.

Tono: Widih.. mantab bro!

Johan: Kalau kalian ada waktu, silahkan saja berkunjung. Planet kami berada di Kluster Sloantim, cincin 24.

Tono: Wah, jauh dong..

Johan: Tenang, mungkin akan ada lagi para Dasandimian disekitar sini. Namun, kembalilah bertugas untuk saat ini. Now, (show paper photo of the harrasser terrorist logo) jika kalian menemukan para peleceh seperti ini dengan atribut ini, jangan segan2 untuk segera melapornya kepada kami.

Tono: (impressed with a regular glossy photo but from an alien) Whoahhh

Kayib: Whoah..

Officer Mimi Maria: wooow..

Johan: Hey, foto dulu. (async) Jangan sampai hilang

Tono: Oh ya (immediately photo with smartphone)... (async) ........... (take)! Okeh

Johan: Simpan baik2, kasih kapten mu itu sangat penting.

Tono: Oke deng. Bapak disini sedang apa?

Johan: Oh, cuman liburan. sama ini..

*all officers*: (nyimak / listen carefully)

Johan: Kami sedang membantu para polisi di dunia untuk menangkap para oknum peleceh sosial. Mereka yang suka menyebarkan ujaran.. melecehkan.

Tono: Oh ya ya tahu.

Johan: Kalian bisa saja mengetrack siapa saja yang nyebarin hoaks.

Tono: Oke oke ya ya.

Johan: Namun, apakah kalian tahu, siapa saja. Misalkan seseorang yang terlihat manis, bersosial. Namun dibalik itu semua, ternyata bohong. Mereka punya socmed, yang digunakan untuk melecehkan siapapun yang memiliki opini yang tidak mereka suka.

Tono: ooo.

Johan: Kalian pernah menangkap orang2 seperti itu?

Tono: Pernah.

Johan: Pasti sedikit.

Tono: Huh? banyak kok?..

Johan: Jangan salah. Identitas luar negeri belum berarti itu. Mereka bahkan akan membuang alat sewaktu2 untuk menggunakan alat yang baru, (show photo of destroyed iPhone 5C with identification chip last time) membuat mereka suulit untuk dilacak.

Tono: (examine)... (understand the example).

Johan: Ada yang keluar, ada yang masuk. Mereka jadi sulit untuk diketahui apalagi dihubungkan.

Tono: Hmmm iya sih, susah. Kenapa harus sini sih?

Johan: Itu dia. Karena di internet, akun bisa dibuang, kemudian ganti akun. sangat tidak worth it untuk diban saja. Tetapi fisik, bisa didapat. Karena merekalah sumber pergerakan tersebut. Tentu, dengan data detail yang ada, kami bisa langsung membantu kalian untuk memproses oknum tersebut secara langsung.

Tono: Oh okay.

Kayib: Jadi lebih efisien gitu?

Johan: Ya. dengan menangkapnya secara langsung, kemungkinan akun peleceh baru yang bermunculan mudah2an semakin kecil. Semakin banyak lebih baik.

<!-- Johan: Namun kita lakukan apa yang bisa. Dengan menangkap  -->

*officers*: OOOhhh.. Hebat hebat 👏👏👏👏👏..

Johan: Tidak hanya disini, diseluruh galaksi.

*officers*: Ya bro, mantab bro, semangat bro!

Johan: And that's all, thancc for your attention.

*officers*: 👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏.

Tono: (confused, how to tell captain about this) Wah, gimana nih.

Johan: Hey, apa GoPro-mu masih nyala?

Info: all 3 officers here has GoPro HERO 10. I mean.. it's not that expensive right? I hope it's not that unecessary spending again like last time I hear on news.

Tono: EH IYA!! MASYA-ALLAH!! ALHAMDULLILAAAAAH (because they got alien moment on tape)!!! (Stop recording)..

Johan: Hati2. (tell avoid upload to YouTube because it would trigger hoax violation) mungkin orang belum percaya. sebaiknya sebarkan dulu secara internal.

Kayib: (GoPro beep, GoPro stop recording & shutdown) Heh bentar... (check GoPro), Yah baterenya habis. lupa lagi hehe.

Tono: (no way!! another alien footage on tape) Yaudah, Alhamdullilah!!! ada lagi!!! AMeeeen..

Johan: Yaudah, cepat kalian balik lagi ke Polsek kalian. jangan sampai corrupt.

Tono: Ya ya, makasih. Yu semuanya!

Info: Yeah, sorry gamers. uhh, we'll have the translation later.

Johan: Okay, people. Mission accomplished.

*everyone*: yaaaay!!!

Info: Vriska also yay, while feel over-tired. yeah, she's still fine. She's a tough lady.

## End

Bonus! [here how to open roof of your Jeep Wrangler Rubicon](https://youtu.be/erAWtA_OSYE ), 21 minute tutorial.

Oh peck, looks like I didn't account for how many seat does Rubicon have, it's only 4. the back is wide empty bagage. I mean, people who sit very back just sits like that, even services provided custom leanside window seat.. idk..

nevermind [there's 7](https://youtube.com/shorts/uKidPTOWsdI?feature=share ). NO, uhhhhhh [eh whatever](https://youtu.be/GqfhYsY0P4Q ).

Tavros' Jeep full UUID Plate is `ce28818d-47db-46a1-9b5e-9b52c4bb7571`, `ATOR-7571`.  
Vriska's Jeep Grand Cherokee full UUID is `15b1a2f8-e913-44dc-8cf1-dbc523a4d40f`, `8BAL-D40F`. Sometimes they need closed ones either to blend in or what while still maintaining versatility. And Tavros could contantly broke the side glass due to his big horn if he drive it, so he sit on the middle center.  
We imported both of these also from Indonesia (just like Sky's IONIQ 5), Yep, Indonesia thankfully had the syndicator or whatever.  
thancc [Online UUID Generator](https://www.uuidgenerator.net/ ).

Last time on the Acid vat when that guy had implant, now this guy here switches phones. He buy used smartphones randomly around phone pawn shops. When he finished the phone, he break & throw it away. But, as a member of the terrorist group, all items must be installed the identification nano cards. Idk why, maybe the group wants to retrieve it sometimes later, and thankfully that's a mistake we can exploit yeah.

Speaking of shrinking numbers of harrasser account, unfortunately in the future it does not happen. Although firstly the revenge starts against Dasandim (entering Anti-Defamation era), and later followed by even worse toxicity & harrassments spread across galaxies like before but worse. Well depends in real life, will the harrassment has become as worse as I think in the future, we'll find out in years.

Well hear me out though. If numbers of toxicity IRL **DID** shrank in the fiscal around 2030 to 2050, then in Perkedel Cinematic Universe, there will be no Anti-Defamation rule yey!!! Please gamers, work this out! Japanese style anti-defamation while more lenient in Dasandim, it's still a hell on world! You can be caught / banned just for a simple violation, like `cuman bercanda doang` pranks!!!

But please though, don't be toxic for this, coz job is tiresome that.. No matter what happens, Alternians & others in this gen of Dasandimian Interpol will retire in respect, a.k.a. Graduate. There they will have fun or whatever fun passion in here. Yes of course, depending on if Anti Defamation status, would be there difference. It's still long time, your job as a gamer here is... **don't be toxic**, that's all! I know you have opinions you don't like, me too! I hate paywalls! but you already know, how much I regretful become toxic to them. I wish didn't do that. and you also had another spectrums too. Yeah, if you can stop, apologize and stop. even it's a terrible & cringe apology, just cease being toxic. idk..

Hey why not give that wandering trader / pedagang kaki lima something special? that guy is actually one of us! Darrin Atalyon. Just a random overseer though. Dasandim has Overseer Alliance. All they do is just look at some interesting events. that's it. They can disguise to be anything, so to blend in. They can choose to join fight, or just watch, but not hinder us in our battle. They are just like you gamers, who wears VR. sitting in between scenes, all immersive anywhere on the map. What strict rule then? Simple, make sure that your body cams all over your body are standby. these bodycams constantly records & upload all moments from each camera back to Dasandim, & then sent to Viorfa for them to be reprocessed.

Now, Vriska. Next time hit his neck vagus nerve to make him fall asleep & could not think to fight back. That should syncope the target or the best weakening to be for certain amount of time. Don't worry, you can still manipulate the limbs, **without the central head being concious**. Be careful!! **Just hit the neck, not the brain**. Brain is very sensitive, and if you hit brain, he will concussion & he could die & you would get penalty `Target killed`.

Okay it's hard to make him syncope, he's as strong as you, Vriska. But there you have it, could be used for another.
