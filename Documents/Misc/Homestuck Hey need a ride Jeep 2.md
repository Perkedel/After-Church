## End

Bonus! [here how to open roof of your Jeep Wrangler Rubicon](https://youtu.be/erAWtA_OSYE ), 21 minute tutorial.

Oh peck, looks like I didn't account for how many seat does Rubicon have, it's only 4. the back is wide empty bagage. I mean, people who sit very back just sits like that, even services provided custom leanside window seat.. idk..

Tavros' Jeep full UUID Plate is `ce28818d-47db-46a1-9b5e-9b52c4bb7571`, `ATOR-7571`.  
Vriska's Jeep Grand Cherokee full UUID is `15b1a2f8-e913-44dc-8cf1-dbc523a4d40f`, `8BAL-D40F`. Sometimes they need closed ones either to blend in or what while still maintaining versatility. And Tavros could contantly broke the side glass due to his big horn if he drive it, so he sit on the middle center.  
We imported both of these also from Indonesia (just like Sky's IONIQ 5), Yep, Indonesia thankfully had the syndicator or whatever.
