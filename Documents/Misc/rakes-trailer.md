# Rakes Official Trailer

Rakes is combination of You Don't Know Jack, Who Wants to be a Millionaire, & Texas Hold'em Poker.

The dealer will hand out the question on the flop box field. Bet how much you want. Then, you answer with which answering card. wants it A, B, C, or D. submit which one correct. and the River, which is the answer will be revealed after all has submitted. Correct answer wins the bet, and if there is more than 1 correct player, it'll split equally.

There are also various types of question like ones in ydkj. DisOrDat uses discussion model like in YDKJ Back to School Team Game, so you write with marker which Dis or the Dat for each prompt on this special answering card, or both if the question has it. submit, and the River which is the answer will reveal which arrow should which prompt points to. As simple as that.

First player staked 1 Million in chip count wins. another player that gets 1M subsequently enters the position, until 3 of them.

### Poker room

(everyone sat on a poker table)

...

...

Jobson Mudaya: What are we exactly doing in here?

Dave F'dyozim: Are we playing poker?! I can't poker, let alone ever played this in my life..

Cookie Masterson: Who said we're playing poker?

Malfrik Adaz: What?

Cookie: (put question card side up onto the flop box field).

Kulto Fayazz (yes, he has streth torso ability): Okay, (stand & stretch torso to read the question)!!... uh.. `Who's the first to FABLIZ in the FARTAZZ?`.. `Fabliz`, `Mulaz`, `Delos`, or `Balfez`. Okay, (unstretch back and sitt).

Cookie on your hand, you have serveral cards to answer. the suits answering A to D respectively ♠️ Spade , ♥️ Heart, ♦️ Diamond, and ♣️ Club. secretly reveal these to yourself, pick the suit you think to answer correctly, and submit which suit over, to answer. Bet first, then answer.

*all players*: (bet)...

Cookie: Good. now answer.

Kulto: Uh okay, that's gotta be, (submit ♠️ 5)..

*rest of them*: (also answer `Fabliz`)..

Cookie: And here's the *River*. (reveal answer card matching the question).

Kulto: Oh, do we win?

Cookie: Each of you collects 250 Kvz. Because you guys staked 1000 Kvz, and all of you correct. The difference with poker is that more than 1 player can win. if there are more, then it'll split like just happened here. Also, finally first player 1 Million wins, then subsequently up to 3 winner in total or all if you wish.

Kulto: Ooh, I see.

Jobson: Huh not bad. I hope I can keep getting this..

Cookie: Are you sure? there are more types too. But I'm pretty sure with just a quick tutorial you can do so.

Jobson: I guess?

Kulto: Hey, It's like You Don't Know Jack we just saw on TV last month, relax.

Jobson: Oh, Jack? Okay, I see, (remember YDKJ Dasandm TV show ) getting back.. (remembered) okay.

Dave: Wow, we playing it now? I'm famous!

Cookie: So, should we get started?

Jobson: Okay, bring it on.

Cookie: And I have a surprise. (walkie talkie to Vriska), Players ready. All yours. (release button)

Vriska Serket: (portal to the poker room), (enter towards)..

Dave: Oh c'mon, you k'dding me?
