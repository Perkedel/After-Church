You see, we right now are in the era of Cognitive Computing, shout out to [Christopher Barnatt](https://youtu.be/3VXlRkUbWD4 ) from [ExplainingComputers.com](https://explainingcomputers.com). In fact we're at its peak, every factories uses AI now, believe it or not. Many forms though, not just chat gpt. Okay, **Aradia would pick ChatGPT**!

(Exist on list! `2. OuijaGPT / Chatboard`, 30 pts)!!!

Info: Fun Fact, as Aradia's Oujia Fetch modus starts acting up due to incompatibility with Godot Engine this universe runs on, the engineers helped her fix her Ouija by installing chatting AI system. born OuijaGPT. It uses Google BARD API, but it can also be switched to Microsoft Bing anytime if so desired. the OuijaGPT is easy to operate. Talk to the pointer, then put it so the lens is above `SUBMIT`.
