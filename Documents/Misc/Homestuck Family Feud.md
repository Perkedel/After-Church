Schmitty: Now, bring Yess & Nope over here! (async) Oh wow, that's..

*audience*: (async) 👏👏👏👏👏👏👏

Yess Cheroz: (to the buzz table right) Here we go boys!

Nope Laxond: (to the buzz table left)...

Schmitty: Okay. Are you ready?

Yess & Nope: Yeah!

Nope: okay.

Schmitty: We got 6 answers right here. So,

> Once upon a time a group of Alternians joined Intergalactic Law Enforcement Alliance here in Dasandim. Aradia Megido, as one of the Alternians who joined there, among others were given an opportunity to pick any item you'd like, free of charge. Called `Dasandim Issue Market Day`.

Schmitty: Now the question is, (round).

Yess: (buzz)!!

Nope: (late to buzz)!!

Schmitty: Yess.

Yess: **CHAT GPT!!**

*audience*: 🗿🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣, 👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏!!

Schmitty: (flabbergasted a bit)?.... Okay, okay, not a bad answer either. You see, we right now are in the era of Cognitive Computing, shout out to [Christopher Barnatt](https://youtu.be/3VXlRkUbWD4 ) from [ExplainingComputers.com](https://explainingcomputers.com). In fact we're at its peak, every factories uses AI now, believe it or not. Many forms though, not just chat gpt. Okay, **Aradia would pick ChatGPT**!

(Exist on list! `2. OuijaGPT / Chatboard`, 30 pts)!!!

Info: Fun Fact, as Aradia's Oujia Fetch modus starts acting up due to incompatibility with Godot Engine this universe runs on, the engineers helped her fix her Ouija by installing chatting AI system. born OuijaGPT. It uses Google BARD API, but it can also be switched to Microsoft Bing anytime if so desired. the OuijaGPT is easy to operate. Talk to the pointer, then put it so the lens is above `SUBMIT`. The pointer will move very fast typing its answer. you can see what it typed with the hologram display above. ; in Hexagon Engine, all fetch modus in any characters are now all same using an intuitive menu selections. An industry standard on pretty much on all technologies, in UI/UX. Therefore requiring an Oujia to pick which item made it outrageous and the worst User Experience ever. Therefore, this Ouija no longer functions. To avoid wasting such precious historical module, engineers then took apart the Ouija, let the spirit free, and install a computer that makes it work for modern day. It does not take item, but instead a chatting board, called OuijaGPT, since it basically an AI chatting. By default, the board relies on Google's BARD, but can be switched if need be to e.g. Microsoft Bing.

Yess: No that's it, I got couple Teslas in my house too.

Schmitty: (head snug back tilt body back a bit) 🤨🤨🤨🤨🤨.....

*audience*: (increase laugh a bit)

Schmitty: You gotta stop doing that. NO I mean, reduce that. I don't think that's good, what happen with other cars? Sure you wouldn't use another copy of same model don't you?

Yess: No, 1 for each model.

Schmitty: That's better. But still though. perhaps you gave it or sell maybe, so others can own.

Yess: (discomfort a bit) Yeah man, Okay, I know. Alot of my friends says so.

Schmitty: Oh really? haah.. Yeah. You can spend better for like.. entirely more different stuffs, buy games, y.. you know, games don't take space unlike cars, you could've complete Steam collections, and everyone else can still buy same, unlike cars. See?

Yess: Oh okay.

Schmitty: Note it. Don't need to thank me, thank Kaorfa. ... SO!, speaking about collecting about cars, We got something veeery important to tell you all about this. Everyone please stay, we're not done yet. LaxoOOnd??, Come here.

<!-- The car must be given because if not, it will be auctioned. there is one notorious guy named Gostak Lambor. He always wins every single time, yet he leave all his autos in garage field left to rot. If he got to sell it, it will be resold more expensive without refurbishing any of them. Rotten as is, at a price of 16 regular kidneys. The car gotta be given fast, because Gostak is really wanted it, do not let Gostak have it, he's a bad guy! hence why Laxond made wins, emotion relieved. Gostak pronoun is He/Him. Schmitty tried his best to disguise his pronoun to make it even more difficult to track, although he did had mistake because Schmitty is not used to neopronouns. Hey, if you harrass us, you will have no place, I warned you.-->

(Laxond family came back to stage)

*audience*: 👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏, (Nope is glittered with CRT glass shards around him, stop applause) ohhhh, oh my God what happen?

Schmitty: Whoa, Nope.. You okay? You got shards on you. What's going on?

Lala: Oh, um, he, we just went to Angery Room. We're so lucky you guys have that. Thank you so much

Schmitty: Ah yess, we indeed have Angery Rooms same level with Airsoft battle room underground there. So if you wanna check it out, go ahead, it's only 150 Kivrontz for 2 hours, so you can play as much and as many items you'd like to smash. ... But you gotta clean yourself man, you could hurt yourself and others.

Mosk Kand: (enter stage with strong vacuum cleaner)!!, (vacuum clean Nope while brushing shards off)!...

Schmitty: Nowh, okay. It looks better like that. (assist clean up)! ! !, Okay, now. Look, see, it's clean now. C'mon, let's see the important things here. ... Hey stop crying man?

Nope: (hug cry Lala) 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭!!!

Schmitty: (pat) Hey, c'mon. This is not your end, buddy. We're not done yet. Look look, the screen! there. Hey, Udah, jangan nangis. Ini loh, kalian menang. (point) Tuh lihat.

Schmitty: Okay, so here's our contract for the dealer of this brand new car. let me zoom this (operator zoom), okay. Now let's highlight this.

(highlight)

<!-- Well, we gotta give it. otherwise we punished. Obviously we don't want to be punished. So what do we do? -->

Schmitty: It says here, that *We must give the car no matter what condition this game is.*, *No return allowed, must give*, and it *has to be given 5 days after we signed this deal*. Yeah, we gotta give that, coz (point again the punishments) look, if we violate any above, *we'll be punished & the punishment is as whatever the dealer wants to do like.* Okay, okay, pretty.. I mean of course nobody wants to be punished right, we got to live. So we're stuck. What do we do now?

<!-- GIVE IT TO THE LEFT! GIVE-IT-TO-THE-LEFT! chant -->

Pulo Sewu (Yes, that same medhok troll): Guys! follow me! Give-it-to-the-left,

*audiences*: 👏GIVE-IT-👏TO-THE-👏LEFT 👏,👏,👏(repeat & louder)..

<!-- ANd that's correct, so Laxond congratulations you just won brand new..... -->

Schmitty: EexACTly. So Laxond,

Paul: Ayam! NO WAY!!

Schmitty: (very loud) **CONGRATULATIONS, YOU JUST WON,**

*audience*: WHOOOOOOOO👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏

Schmitty: **BRAND NEW, ULTIMATIZED, HYUNDAI, IONIQ 5, SIGNATURE, LONG RAAAAAAAAAANGE!!!!!!!**

*Laxond*: <span style='font-size:xx-large;'>**😄😄😄😄😄😄😄😄😄😄😄😄😄😄😄😄😄😄😄😄😄AWHDFLIAHSDLJBAOIUFGBNAEFDSJKFGBLSBDFVBNSRLETGUBSOUEDNIFL!!!!!**</span> (run towards the show car & hug)

Schmitty: Guys wait no! that's not the car, (point to back right stage entry door) Ah there!

<!-- Cookie drives the storage cart pulling the car sitting on top of the rolly pallet -->

(Cookie carry IONIQ 5. car sit on the rolly palette, palette pulled by forklift, fork folded for safety)

Cookie Masterson: (driving forklift, fork folded) (honk) (hoooonk)!!, Who wants the brand new Electric car? Come pick it up, it's just for you!

*Laxond*: (turn & run towards the real car)!!!

Nope: (stop in front of Cookie) GIVE ME THAT KEY!!

Cookie: (async) (throw fob) Here you go..

Nope: (async) (catching), (got it & metal excitement curving) WOOOOOOO!!! 

Cookie: Have fun & safe (async 2) driving!

Nope: (async 2) (run towards front right door), (press unlock on fob)!! YEEEAAAH!!!! (Open door)!!, (enter & close), WOOOOOOOOO!!!! YEAAAAAH!!!!

*Laxond*: (enter all)!!! (do something)!! (praise the Lord)!!!

Nope: **HALELUYAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!!!**

Cookie: Okay, wear your seatbelt everybody! (run again)... Off we go!!! (leave stage bring everything to outside to release the car)

<!-- Now why do we asked? fortunately, we were give why, but let's not destroy that guy reputation. (explain above notoriety bla2)-->

*audience*: (happy wholesome moved) 👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏

Schmitty: Wow. I'm glad I can help. Whow. Now you must be wondering, why this time unlike previous show, we gotta give the car anyways? Well, luckily we had ever questioned. Thankfully, they're nice, so won't always hurt if you question on something. They said there was that one guy. Can't tell you who's name they are, let's not ruin their reputation today. ... Maybe later..

*audience*: 😂😂😂🤣🤣🤣😂😂😂🤣🤣🤣!!!...

Schmitty: So yeah there, this one guy. First though, usually ungiven gifts will be returned, but you just saw we're not allowed to. What would happen you ask? **Of course auction it**, who would've thought, right? **And that's.. where the problem lies**. You see, in.. that auction, that one guy, aaaaaalways wins every item over there, no idea where the heck did they got the money. Nada. They just wwwINS! So what? What did they do? They just abandon it somewhere in his own.. field... thingy, yeah, rot. Hi.., I mean.. Their garage, garage field is full of rotten cars from where they were started, to this day. Sure, I can see why the dealers HAte, this guy. They even, if they have to sell it, **they kept or raise the price, like a GPU Scalper from Earth, GOOOOSH**, that gut right there. Oh.. my God. Folks, I wish you are not like him. Them. Ugh. Look, please do not harrass.. them, Okay you know what? it's He/Him. Just.. don't harrass. We aren't sure if he had trouble or what, just, leave him alone, okay? So yeah. The dealer is afraid if that car ends to his hand because it had to be auctioned when nobody gets this. Also, you know why 5 days limit? **HE HAS BEEN F8888NG WANTING IT RIGHT NOW! ON RESERVED, EVEN!!! JESUS CHRIST!!** Like appointing someone for legally kidnapping eh?!?!?!? .. Any idea to uhh give this guy a lesson?! YOu know? No need to answer, keep it yourself to home.

*audience*: ... 👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏

Schmitty: OH OKay, we already pass the time. So that is all for.. Family, Feud! I'm Josh Schmitty, And Signing out. If there is something that is amiss, amistake, awhatever, we apologize. And thank youuu for your attention. See ya! (leave stage to left door)...
