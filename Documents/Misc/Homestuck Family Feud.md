Schmitty: Now, bring Yess & Nope over here! (async) Oh wow, that's..

*audience*: (async) 👏👏👏👏👏👏👏

Yess Cheroz: (to the buzz table right) Here we go boys!

Nope Laxond: (to the buzz table left)...

Schmitty: Okay. Are you ready?

Yess & Nope: Yeah!

Nope: okay.

Schmitty: We got 6 answers right here. So,

> Once upon a time a group of Alternians joined Intergalactic Law Enforcement Alliance here in Dasandim. Aradia Megido, as one of the Alternians who joined there, among others were given an opportunity to pick any item you'd like, free of charge. Called `Dasandim Issue Market Day`.

Schmitty: Now the question is, (round).

Yess: (buzz)!!

Nope: (late to buzz)!!

Schmitty: Yess.

Yess: **CHAT GPT!!**

*audience*: 🗿🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣, 👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏!!

Schmitty: (flabbergasted a bit)?.... Okay, okay, not a bad answer either. You see, we right now are in the era of Cognitive Computing, shout out to [Christopher Barnatt](https://youtu.be/3VXlRkUbWD4 ) from [ExplainingComputers.com](https://explainingcomputers.com). In fact we're at its peak, every factories uses AI now, believe it or not. Many forms though, not just chat gpt. Okay, **Aradia would pick ChatGPT**!

(Exist on list! `2. OuijaGPT / Chatboard`, 30 pts)!!!

Info: Fun Fact, as Aradia's Oujia Fetch modus starts acting up due to incompatibility with Godot Engine this universe runs on, the engineers helped her fix her Ouija by installing chatting AI system. born OuijaGPT. It uses Google BARD API, but it can also be switched to Microsoft Bing anytime if so desired. the OuijaGPT is easy to operate. Talk to the pointer, then put it so the lens is above `SUBMIT`. The pointer will move very fast typing its answer. you can see what it typed with the hologram display above. ; in Hexagon Engine, all fetch modus in any characters are now all same using an intuitive menu selections. An industry standard on pretty much on all technologies, in UI/UX. Therefore requiring an Oujia to pick which item made it outrageous and the worst User Experience ever. Therefore, this Ouija no longer functions. To avoid wasting such precious historical module, engineers then took apart the Ouija, let the spirit free, and install a computer that makes it work for modern day. It does not take item, but instead a chatting board, called OuijaGPT, since it basically an AI chatting. By default, the board relies on Google's BARD, but can be switched if need be to e.g. Microsoft Bing.

<!-- Cheroz right lost this, but the car has to be given or the studio will be punished by the deealer. so give car to Laxond left -->
<!-- The car must be given because if not, it will be auctioned. there is one notorious guy named Gostak Lambor. He always wins every single time, yet he leave all his autos in garage field left to rot. If he got to sell it, it will be resold more expensive without refurbishing any of them. Rotten as is, at a price of 16 regular kidneys. The car gotta be given fast, because Gostak is really wanted it, do not let Gostak have it, he's a bad guy! hence why Laxond wins, emotion relieved. -->
