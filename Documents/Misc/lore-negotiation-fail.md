# A Snippet if Lore fanfiction to extend someone's lore (film, comic, novel) causes outrage among community
idk where film I would put this. This time, let's hope I don't have to use this. World is not always good, there are alot of fans, but again not all of them are well behaved. If I started to make a fanfiction to extend that lore, there is a potential community disagrees. I believe, e.g. it probably could happen when I tried to resurrect people, fans are extremely heartbroken seeing him/her died tragically. Idk, if you are sad then why do you disagree if I make them alive again? Just saying.

anyways so um.. here's what representation of the drama I came up with. There maybe some changes, like to optimize the lore I was talking about, logic rearrangement, etc., but basically similar I think.

> GET OUT OUT! Is it everyone? .. YEAH, CLOSE THE DOOR!!!

# Begin
## Edge of the universe
David Estherson: (finished the portal to another verse setup) Okay, the set complete! 7 keys?

Kirnda (key holder 5): Rock and loaded! Proceed the yoink.

David: Not so fast, remember. As usual, we gotta take a look at this first. Then when it come, you guys pick it up, okay.

Kirnda: Oh okeh.

David: Folks?

Ambin Chachichur: Yes.

David: I'll go first. (open the address of the lore we wanted to make fanfiction of).... (enter)!

(portal open)

David: Alright, So.. Lore (insert franchise name) from (company name). (if there are more than 1 cinematic universe from the same company) Geez, these guys are inconsistent in what they're doing. Hopefully took the right one.

David: (if there is only 1 cinematic universe from the same company) Okay, so this is.. what do you have. ... ... okay.

David: (enter).... ...

## Someone's lore verse
David: Mmm, okay. Got another edge. (draw another spatial portal), Where should we go here? wait wait. umm.. (kneel), (scan the edge ground with the gadget)..... (it's a normal soil), Okay..

David: (deploy spatial portal to that lore's earth somewhere)! Okayyy.....yuh. Normal Earth.. Guys?

Ambin: Yes sir. (follow)

Endib Stokokolor: (follow)

## Earth from that lore
JOELwindows7: At this point, the story should be different in every occasion. So when you see the film, it may not looks like bellow anymore, as I now call out the name these days. Here I have provided the example to give you an idea. It's exagerated so to make my points clear. Hey, not to give hate or what, but here, yeah you see.

David: (walk together) Huh, Alright.. so this Earth's condition is rather similar. But of course can't underestimate what danger lies ahead. .. ... ... (saw a church) Oh look! a church. Wonder what's going on. (enter the church)

Ambin & Endib: (follow)!

St. Johnson: Welcome, do you have invitation?

David: (realized why did he spontaneously trespass an event at the church) ... Wait, Why I'm..

St. Johnson: Just come in.

David: Huh, thank you. ... (enter) Guys?

Ambin & Endib: (also enter)

## Church Quetzelar (Christian Protestant)
Father Joseph: (sorrow mood) So, is there is any question? Well, it's time for families to give final message.

David: it's a... Lila Hendricson. (look her frame, looks like a kawaii anime girl) Wow, so cute.

Brian Kimmel: (nudge back) Bro! give her message!

David: OH, sorry, uh where is.

Brian: Just use mine. I'll take another. (take another mail paper)... (reenter queue)

Ambin & Endib: (enter queue)

David: Hey, sorry to ask., ..

Brian: SSsss,, ahh.. ...

David: Uh, Okay, I'll find out

Brian: Drunk drivers.

David: Um, many?

Brian: (bittered face sorrow)... Yes.

David: I'm sorry man.

Brian: Yes, you're right, she was the cutest family member we ever had. sssss..

David: (write message)..

> Dear, Lila
> I am sorry such terribly horribly murderous incident has to happen to you
> The world is cruel, that's right.
> I just wanna say, great luck out there
> may all aspects see & prevent this from hapening again
> Amen
> - David Estherson, from Perkedel Cinematic Universe. Shalom kenal

David: (wrap the message) Guys you done?

Ambin: (wrapped the message) Yes..

> Wtf is this accident! f**cking hell!!!
> don't worry ~~we'll get you ou~~ may God accept your presence
> amen
> - ambin, Perkedel

Endib: Hopefully this good. (nervously wrap) I'm terrible at this.
