# [VS. SKY](https://gamebanana.com/mods/44555 ) IS PECKING BACK!!! NO PECKING WAY!!!
ONE MORE LEFT!!! **C'MON, YOU CAN DO THIS!** MUST ABLE!

If 3 of them came back, I will make new unique mods for Full Ass. We will **Workshop** that.

wait. this tenseer feels familiar. Coco (Pixar), got a term of comeback to alive, No this presley guy. Well, after all the struggles especially brought the real ancestor to truth state, Coco no longer tied with terms, and did he do, he exposes that the presley is fake ancestor, that guy poisoned real ancestor turns out, and the infamous song is actually personal song for real ancestor daughter in which actually is Coco's uh how many great? yeah grandma.

Now. for us. We planned to stop making mods and abandon FNF fandom entirely as FNF Full ass released, because I hate paywalled improved rendition. pecking hate this so much. That's my *term*. So to 🖕 *why you too?!?! can't great big games be $0?!?!??! I know, but seriously though..*, I set a plan in this contract that this contract ends the time Full Ass released. Whenever the date has been defined, it's that date. After the contract ends, all Wakturia workers must cease making & yoinking mods, archive unfinished jobs, and handover everything to Cleaners. These people then will port everything we've made so far to FNFFA Steam Workshop. That's it. no more, peck you all.

But then, things changes. Maybe I am too but hole. oh why maybe, if it is definitely? But how to not be one? Well, I found it.  
One day, some mods that were gone suddenly came back. first it was [Whitty](ttps://gamebanana.com/mods/44214 ), and then Sky today. That's how it changed my mind. I dehoisted my middle finger, and built `Kontraktua Majoris`. These trophy showcase, contains lost mods (`Protoglin Amexamlef`) that came back. We got 2 right now. Mid Fight Masses still awaiting. I hope they come too.

You can see now, this is the first time in my carreer I think, that I dehoisted middle finger upon softwares that got improvement version but paid. Only FNF that had this. rest of them (Synthfont, Phoenotopia, etc. all of them I found) yea you know. Idk, will I keep dehoisting even if MFM not come back? Right now I expect all 3 to fully dehoist middle finger, idk if this would change to better or worse, idk.

So there you have it. We hope MFM come back too so we can happilly live in peace.

## INTRO
Admiral Zumi Rufthar Leksicorn: Alright, [this](https://github.com/Perkedel/Kaded-fnf-mods/tree/sammer-woost/Admiral_Zumi ) is nice!! What do you think?

Pocingklik Normaz: Amazing!

Zumi: Yeah, I know, it's not perfect. No idea what to build more with, I'm still nervous to get more you know!

Pocingklik: I know. I just uh... Maybe you should try the other one. Remember we've heard there was one Amexamlef came back? Perhaps we can help gamers know there is new version, by porting legacy to here, how about that?

Zumi: Great idea!, well uh complicated. we gotta tell Gyouter about(interupted)

Nurb: (knock door)! ! !! Hey!

Zumi: Yes, (walk to the door) what is it?

Nurb: There's a new guest, sir. He claims to be your old best friend.

Zumi: Alright, is he dangerous?

Nurb: No weapon, except a Swiss Army Knife.

Zumi: Okay....... (going to door), (wait nvm, check laptop first) oh wait.. (close Tab with kemono), (close lid)!, (go to door), (open door), (see through balcony) where?

Nurb: There 👉 (point to new guess).

Zumi: (examine)... (wait a second)!.... (confirmed)!!!

Roig Hermalansa: Hello!

Zumi: (thought he was murdered) Roig?? ... (tear of moved by) ROIG??!

## SPLASH
Song play: SYBS - Bittersweet (YouTube Audio Library) (*because it is almost similar with AHiT's Blue rift song orchestraic edition. more on that later. this is something to do with Yolaine, Subcon relations, etc. etc. yep, Yolaine has young sister, and the song of subcon forest if you entered the second part of the forest, yeah the village.*)

reel of cryptic moments..

okay here's the logo..

ok that's it, stop. now to begin. 
## BEGIN
## X0p1r4t3 Eenvreensment palace
Zumi: (ran towards Roig).. hh hhh hh

*guards*: (follows and guard Zumi)

Zumi: (approached Roig 1 metre away, stop)!! Okay hold! Check impostorness.

Roig: ...

Zumi: Who is `Federal`?!

Roig: The guy that "*shot*" me?

Zumi: What is that *double quotation*?!

*guards*: (also went sus, draw riffle up)!!?

Roig: They bombed me.

Zumi: Wait, how you be here? Oh wait yess. My house exploded. but..

Roig: The bomb is teleporter. they throw my family away into an unknown junkyard dimension.

Zumi: ...

Roig: Brother, It's me. your best friend, same as it was. (remind good old days of drinking coconut water together while working) Do we have coconuts here? I think we are thirsty now.

Zumi: 😢😢😢😢😢..... (hug Roig as hard as possible)!!!! 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭 (absorbtion hiks)!!!

Roig: OHo... (reply arms wrap hug too)..

Zumi: (drop hug) Haaah! man, I ..... I don't... man... Thought I..

Roig: It's okay man. We no longer have federal, at least not in here.

Zumi: That's why I stayed man. This planet is the best!

Roig: Yeah.

Zumi: Come, let me show you my office.

Gunlik Sudur (guard): Sir, these (Roig's parents) too?

Zumi: Oh yeah pls! come here too! come come come. (escort Roig family to Zumi's office) Lets...

## Back to office again
Zumi: (open door), you first.

Roig: (got in)

Mulyono Hermalansa (dad): (got in)..

Dinda Mawar Sutjipto Hermalansa (mom): (got in)..

Zumi: Alright, soo... here's my office.

(camera b roll office)

Zumi: Not that much, but that's where I manage and observe things here. I got.. Well nothing tangible here currently. All in my PC. I've been doing.. people stuffs aaand.. umm [*sharing*](https://odysee.com/@X0P1R4T3-33NSVREENMNT-0FFICIAL:f ) stuffs.. layaa (like a good old days??? I guess)...

Roig: Wow. You've got.. things that lost.

Zumi: Yeah, I.. hear people. things got lost, I hate losses. Also, other things.

Roig: Wait so.. where's ISO, eeh Crack gen, Keygen, and uh everything?

Zumi: umm uh that..

Roig: Whoah, don't say you stopped man. To this day, developers still paywall games and softwares. Why quit like that?

Zumi: Well uuhh, After been doing this.. I feel like, something so tedious here. Something really sus too. Like I have to usually, uh install the softwares, put a patched exe in it or have keygen, etc. etc., and uh.. I got bored. Also, I've noticed these days games gets updated, and uh.. pirates will be rechallenged again, because updates only comes for legit. I then curious.

Roig: 🤨...

Zumi: I know, call me insane, or traitor. I ask dad, credit card. just.. just once. ANd guess that whoahow, it's not that bad. [Steam](https://steampowered.com/ ), btw.., I guess... I am addicted, .. leuuuh... I'm sorry.

Roig: 😦????? So... Hey, remember. There's Adobe still here. Okay, no Adobe, we got GIMP. But in general.. We atleast have tools to come to here! Haven't you heard, `Free` means `Bebas`. *Libre* not price. Therefore, some open source app has paywalled binaries too! You don't know?

Zumi: ...

Roig: Okay, hear me out. I seriously disappointed with you, brother. You quit like that while paywallism pandemics still not stopping at all. Where are you going now? You don't do anything? All you do is sit here aand.. giving food on tables for those crackhead who makes us poor?!

Zumi: Uh, dude. It's complicated. At least I still hate Digital Restriction Management, right?

Roig: Oh man. I believe I lost my only best friend in my life. You no longer sparsdat games.

Zumi: (start *reveal* giant truth) Okay, fine. let's stop. Did I just played your emotion?

Roig: What do you mean?

Zumi: 😏... just wanna know, or really want to know?

Roig: 🤨...?

Zumi: (preparing to go to *giant truth* basement) You know, sparsdating software takes effort. We said it right?

Roig: Oh yeah, I remember.

Zumi: Since games paywallism becomes *endemic* and no longer possible to destroy, We still have things to take.

Roig: Oh.. Okay.

Zumi: (notify Bladewire with chat app)! You just said. Not all open source app have $0 binary.

Roig: Uh hm.

Zumi: (still preparing defense weapons) I have begun to start again my journey, after I find that.. there is a gray area, .. that I can exploit (insert magazine to handgun), thanks to GNU GPL or whatever.. (put handgun to holster). And that's... How not to pay for tools.

Roig: Oh. and this we're going?

Zumi: (look right to door)..

Pocingklik: (knock door)! ! ! Sir?

Zumi: Bring her in.

Pocingklik: (open door), Sir, Bladewire.

Siru Magomalen: Yessir!

Zumi: Greeting. Here's my best friend and his family. Today, we going to the `Giant Truth`.

Siru: yessir.

Zumi: Remember as usual, This is confidential, I mean no (Paywallist) Federals shall know this. I want you to guard us while we're going there.

Siru: Oy (overreact respect pose) yess sir!!

Zumi: Right, let's get going. (start going altogether)

Siru: (began her super agile lightspeed guarding mode & draw swords from hands & legs)!.. (lightspeed here)!, (lightspeed move there)!!..

Roig: Alright, So.. what casual things you do here?

Zumi: Well, we got so many people down there. Many of them are like me, immigrants from various galaxies. Sure, we live well, do jobs, many jobs. not just technologies but also foods, etc. Basically, it's a town. Or maybe a city, been so multi-level of residence here.

Roig: Oh, I thought it's just a secure castle thingy.

Zumi: No, not just that. We put people inside grounds. Much safer than poking out.

Roig: That make sense.

Zumi: And one of the door is right there (point to swing double gate door)?

Lodim (right door guard): (respect pose) Sir?

Moldim (left door guard): (unlock door)...

Roig: Oh, using warehouse door? can car fit in? what about trucks?

Zumi: Well, we got another entrance outside, big one, thick one.

Roig: Alright. there's one inside too?

Zumi: (point to behind) Yeah, there.

Roig: (look behind) Oh. didn't see that. yeah this yard so big, yet empty.

Zumi: We used to put trading spots here, foods I remember, but after hearing news about Federal crackdown somewhere in galaxies, I can't afford to risk people lives anymore. so.. that's all & strict it out (keep them inside & only accept no guest who are Paywallist Federal loyalist).

Roig: hmmm, alright.

Moldim: (unlocked) Door open, sir.

Zumi: Thanks, buddy. (go in altogether)

## X0p1r4t3 City. Level B1
(Zumi, Roig, & Roig's parents got in).

Moldim: (close & lock door again)

Zumi: Alright, to the Giant Truth. follow me, (continue walk) it's crowding here.

Roig: Wow, markets.

Zumi: Yeah, people trades things. Here you can see..

(view trading moments of those markets)

Zumi: people are trading junks. Of course, something we can recycle just like DIY scrap build YouTubers. And we also got.. Electronics. Lots of Arduino boards here, & its related components, very interesting, you should collect them all and maybe recollect the same components coz you never be enough. (found stair & point to that stair) This way (go to stair down).

## Level B2
Roig: MMh! wow, this smells familiar. that car scraps.

Zumi: Yep, automotives. components like engines, alternators, batteries, entertainments, speakers, etc. etc.

Roig: Is there floatation module?

Zumi: Of course there is. Recently that's went viral couple weeks ago. I heard they use a natural stone called `Zerzek` because people here plays [Zerahypt](http://zerahypt.net/ ). but I think it doesn't seems one. Because scientists that discovered it in 2017 avoided that presumably but unconfirmed proprietary trademark name, so we called it.. um what is it?.. Ah! `Venemos`. like its planet name famous for having that stone, `Venemosa`. Very close to Uredith's planet.

Roig: (stop awhile since spotted something) Oh look, is that 3D printed IONIQ 5 dashcluster casing?

Zumi: Oh yeah. uh..

Mudus Untal: Oh! Sir?

Zumi: Hey!

Mudus: Hey look, I've attempted CADding this myself. In case somebody needs replacement, and Hyundai is not in Dasandim at the moment.

Zumi: Wow. Impressive.

Mudus: Thancc, sir! Well uh, I just estimate it. this gonna be incorrect size. I tried to [find](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=hyundai+ioniq+5+3d+model+free&t=brave&ia=web ) everything but [uh](https://sketchfab.com/3d-models/hyundai-ioniq-5-2022-53f1b0e8d2e4473ab543b7f0c67a258a ).. [unnggggh](https://sketchfab.com/3d-models/hyundai-ioniq-5-2022-80e8a085fe774737be9825adfc83bfbd ).. [aan](https://www.3dcadbrowser.com/3d-model/hyundai-ioniq-5-2022 ).. yeah, did not look good. I got [another](https://3dwarehouse.sketchup.com/model/b46ef9dd-2f75-4d0b-9415-9a993f59b286/2022-Hyundai-IONIQ-5?hl=en ) but.. uh I think all of the dashboard is incorrect, and none sometimes.

Zumi: Don't worry, brother. We'll figure this out. zero one four three.

Mudus: yeeahh 😞😞😞😞.

Zumi: Right, see you later. keep going man. that's great modelling.

Mudus: Thanks again, man.

Zumi: (continue walking) no problem. (point to down stair)!

## Level B3
Roig: Right, so, why not use lift in here? Do you have lift here?

Zumi: We have so many actually.

Roig: Why don't use them?

Zumi: Uhhh..

Roig: Don't dare you say that's just because you want to show something else first to me, you market head!

Zumi: Okay, I'm sorry, Yeah, you're right. (look & point with open soup hand at lift crowds over there) But as you can see, everyday, not to mention national holiday, lifts are always crowded.

Roig: 😐😐😐😐😐

Zumi: Want it balcon there, or stuffs lift (good lift) that is larger. No hope. We got lots of things to be delivered, from around galaxies, aand for that.. people of galaxies is not so different. We hate walking on stairs.

Roig: Heeeh. that's... a natural excuse.

Zumi: Honestly can be said so. (continue walk again)

(few metres later)...

Botlim Rooterdaam: Sir? (respect salute).. (saw Roig) Hey dude! want [Fairphone](https://www.fairphone.com/ )?

Roig: (reject what he think is a cheaply Chinese phone) ✋✋!

Zumi: (stop)

Roig: Hey, go on!

Zumi: I recommend you get yourself a new phone. I saw your phone is outdated.

Roig: Uh.. this is Samsung Galaxy A8+ 2018

Zumi: You must change now. that phone gonna *explode* soon.

Roig: Explode? wasn't that..

Zumi: No, you'll lose your data soon. It will suddenly die, no recoverable.

Roig: Man, it works fine..

Botlim: Hey man, I heard Kaorfa had phone like that. Suddenly *exploded*, I mean it's just dead, green screen, no turn on, and lost 100% all data. irrepairable. You should get Fairphone instead!

Roig: Made in China?

Botlim: But it's..

Roig: MMM NA!

Botlim: Hey, WAIT! hear me out! The workplace over there isn't like others. [It's the best!](https://www.fairphone.com/en/impact/good-working-conditions/ ). *They are people too*, they got wage, and whatever that maintain wellbeing something like that.

Roig: (start getting intrigued, go sit on the meatball chair upon the counter) Alright, ... (sitt) is it fast?

Botlim: It is! well uh.. not so fast, but sufficient. You play Genshin?

Roig: No, I'm not interested. What the hell gacha poops.

Botlim: Then, it's decent for you. And

Roig: And what? Why I'm sitting here? I supposed to (point with left hand open to neighbour Samsung dealer left beside by this counter) get Samsung Galaxy S22 Ultra.

Botlim: Whoahh, that's drastic. We imported that phone all the way from Earth to here. It gets more expensive now. How much is it again?

Setrum Rooterdam: Three Thousand Kivrontz (3000 Kvz, about IDR 30 Million).

Botlim: WHuuueh!! adds 1 thousand, bro! It supposedly 2000 Kvz (about IDR 20 Million).

Roig: 🤨🤨🤨, I mean, that Fairphone is imported from China, which also is Earth too isn't it?

Botlim: Well, something special about Fairphone, it's subsidized, because.. it's repairable plus kindnesses there of course. Only for 750 Kvz. Originally 1200 Kvz.

Roig: Alright, lemme try. This time. I don't have time here, Zumi wants me to upgrade now, because this phone here.. is from 2018. Pretty old quick huh?

Botlim: Yeah. aand.. it's intentional. They want you to buy new phone. **Planned Obsolesence**, you know. And btw, Buying Samsung here, is stupid. I could not find service center here in Dasandim, neither Fairphone, but only Fairphone that encourage you to.. 😏😏 (whistle suiit, suiit), 😘😘! You know what I mean?

Roig: Alright. speaking of Rule 34 (nake her body a.k.a. self repair), you got sparepart too?

Botlim: Of course we have! lots of tentants here sells 'em! check 'em out!

Roig: hmmf, okay.

Botlim: Right, you must be want.. [Fairphone 4](https://shop.fairphone.com/en/ ). (show & handover demo unit) This one is the best.

Roig: (examine the unit) hmm... wait. Where's headphone jack? it's gone too??!

Botlim: Yeah, Fairphone since 4 removes it.

Roig: AH! f8888 hell. They too?

Botlim: Well, We also sell Razer headphones, cabled too..

Roig: Because I know, wireless sucks! lots of latencies.

Botlim: Which is why, exclusive for this mall, we got this (put on the table..) soundcard, absolutely free. it also has passthrough for charger USB-C port.

Roig: Alright, I guess. Just.. very disappointed.

Botlim: Well, you might not want to, because, this sound card is even better than if it is built in. Audiophile approved. I know you want not just enough, don't you?

Roig: Yeah, I guess it's time.. for days of d8888.

Botlim: 🤣🤣🤣🤣!!! Right, we deal about this? 750 Kvz.

Roig: Alright, let me wallet (take out phone & open Kivrontz wallet app)

Botlim: Oh that's alright, you better transfer data first..

Zumi: No no no, I just buy it for him. You're welcome buddy.

Roig: No no, no need. I have 30000 Kvz, Just lemme do it. Let me transfer data first. (began transfer data), (prepare USB flashdisk), (login Gmail & setup new phone)..

Botlim: (prepared EDC to the counter glass table). Okay, fill your name here, and whenever you ready, scan in the checkout.

Roig: Looks nothing, just contacts, good.

Botlim: Wow, dude, where's your photo?

Roig: Saved on computer, I don't do much photo, I download *homeworks* mostly to my computer. There's nothing instagramable other than scrap metals.

Botlim: Ouhh, sorry kids. You mean.. the federals?

Roig: How do you know?

Botlim: (head swing back to point at Setrum)

Setrum: (upset of remembering the incident)

Botlim: Thank God, he's here. whew, I hate paywallist federals.

Roig: Okay, I think that's it. idk what else. Time to checkout (press multitask menu, go back to Kivrontz app window), Seven fifty Kivrontz.. (scan QR).. (success), Okay. let's do this. (press pay). ... (failed) huh? umm hold on.

Botlim: Reception here is good? wanna WiFi?

Roig: Okay, password?

Botlim: `LetusLukararim9`. L all caps, no space.

Roig: (show typed password) Like this?

Botlim: Yeah.

Roig: ookay.. (go back to Kivrontz app)... Try again. (scan QR), and... (press pay).... (failed). Oh c'mon.

Botlim: Well, maybe memory leak. restart your phone?

Roig: Yeah, that's what I'll do. (Hold power until power off window appear), (press restart).

Botlim: ...

Zumi: ...

Roig: ... ... ... (phone turns on but green screen and that's it) Huh wait what the hell?

Botlim: What? lemme see..

Roig: (put the phone)

Botlim: OOOOOOOOOOoooooouuwwwh..

Roig: Uuuhhh, no...

Botlim: I'm sorry man. Looks like your phone finally *exploded*. duar.

Roig: Wait.. It can't be! (force shutdown old phone by pressing power longer until it's off), Charger pls!

Botlim: Okay (give USB-C end to Roig).

Roig: (connect).. ... .... ... (still not turn on at all with charging status) uh..

Botlim: Yeeeeah.. he's dead. And you're lucky. Right after you've transfered everything. Kaorfa.. well not at all. lost everything.

Roig: 😐😐😐😐😐😐

Botlim: And look, in case there still something left in it, it's impossible. nobody can extract the data to this day if it is Samsung. Even other 3rd party repairs, they can't. Maybe you wanna sell the parts here?

Roig: No, of course not!

Botlim: Okay. After all I don't want too.

Roig: (ponder his new phone with scepticism upon this unexpected quest)....

Zumi: Okay, Should I..

Roig: No no, let me take my ledger (take out crypto ledger).. (press scan fingerprint with right thumb to unlock)... uh.. it's dead. battery dead. um, My private key copy is in my home. I don't have cash.

Zumi: Well, forget about it. (take out phone & scan QR) Did you missed birthday gift months ago?

Roig: I don't get big gifts, My dad makes things for me.

Zumi: Well, time for a best friend to gift once again. (press pay)!

Roig: Okay, thancc. I really want that S22 Ultra though..

Zumi: But..

Roig: I see.

Botlim: Well, great luck! If you need help here, you can just contact me. (give physical business card).

Roig: (take & examine card)... (store in pocket).

Zumi: Right, great luck with your new phone! let's continue (continue walk)..

JOELwindows7: The parents are still silent, I know.

## Level B4
Zumi: Hey, do you have arcade in your house? I mean, in your junkyard?

Roig: I do have, but they are such an old retrotech stuffs. Mostly used items thrown away, people repaired it.

Zumi: Well, you can see now, we got newer tech powered arcades here, even the classic ones ike Pinball, those have new techs in it.

Roig: Wow.

Zumi: Well, if you'd like to play, this is the place. You can use your ledger to save data & upload to your cloud. That's right, only needs your ID card. If you want to register your Dasandimian citizenship, there's the office, (point to the Immigration Registration Center) right there. Everything, ID, crypto, passport, there, all in one. Just that, ready to use. Even play arcade right now, exchange money too there.

Roig: HOH! So easy!!

Zumi: Yeah, king Dasan (& Queen Andim) wants to have friends & families. And other else, it's been so hard to register to a nation. Therefore why not make it so easy as signing up on a website & start uploading stuff da right now.

Roig: Well... I guess I have to explore more about Dasandim, what the hell is this planet?

Zumi: Alot! Can't explain in particular even.

JOELwindows7: Hmm, okay hear me out, Roig had Kivrontz wallet. You know, Kivrontz wallet is part of the Dasandim citizenship, yes that Social Seucity Number. He has been a Dasandimian technically, but Roig didn't knew this yet, because only Dasandim tightly integrate cryptocurrency as a nationwide currency & as well as other things that makes All in One User account, is that.

Pottum Nodt: (press B4 button on vending machine), (scan NFC with ledger), (take just fallen drink bottle out of caddy), (open cap), (drincc right away)!!!

# Level B5
Roig: (downed a stair).. Hey, btw, Why don't we use escalator here?

Zumi: (eyes on the crowding escalator) Well just look at that.

Roig: Oh.. my God.

Zumi: People really hates to use leg just to get there. Lifts already full, and now escalator.

Roig: Then why not make stairs fun? like.. add some interactables stuff like that..

Zumi: People got bored. And many of them are not interested.

Roig: Yeeeuh!

Zumi: Remember, they are (racism warn hoisted).. forget about this.

Roig: (knew this is racist) Yeah, don't talk this.

Denf (game disc seller): Steam key, for cheap! Limited stock!

## Level B6
Roig: (noticed stair is very long) Wow, this one is.. long.

Zumi: Yeah, because this floor is for physical arcades & amusements basically. Roller Coaster, Bom bom car (Bumper car), Ice skate, roller skate, simulators, whatever rides.

Roig: Okay, that usually should be on the Ground level.

Zumi: Yeah.. we are lazy, me & customers. Lazy to move the intruments to here, lazy to down just to get here, lazy to... to move it again. and uh.. Didn't know when to stop digging, in fact, this was lowest level, but then yeah. Don't worry though, we already have thought of those reinforcements here and there.

Roig: Alright, hope not collapse.

Zumi: We check every 5 years. occassionally everyday we check some. See if things got rusted, needs changing, whatever danger came, etc. etc. Yeah.

Roig: Well, I notice, we haven't passed any restaurant. even the top floor, where usually food court is.

Zumi: Good question. This mall is huge, too tired & starved & die to go up the most just to get there. That's why, (point softly to pathway to food court area) far there, another mall cell dedicated just for it. Lots of types foods there, and including controvercial ones (pork, lard, crustaceans, whales, bats, seals, roach, worms, maggots, rabbit (Sate Kelinci); except pets like cat, dog, etc.), just for other people of galaxies who take that. anything you can find.

Roig: Okay. well, I'll a look at that later.

Zumi: Yeah, if you happen to go there, look for red sign, which is controvercy mark. You probably want to examine carefully those with it before going in. The sign says which ingredient exists in that restaurant that you should know.

Roig: Okay. If I may ask, how do you arrange those floors for restaurants?

Zumi: Umm I think it's like.. more upper, more buffet (bespoke premium) it is, and more down, more indie (street food) it is. Yeah, that's uh how do we think.

Roig: Like.. you not afraid lots of polution here?

Zumi: Yeah, that's why I thought it up. lots of vents there, No gas stove allowed, electric only, vents are special, it's slippy anti-stick. No grease sticks, easier to clean. just spray water & soap! yeah!

Roig: That gotta be expensive pulling down vents to here right? not to mention how many path maze it would've been to clean them all.

Zumi: I know. street food that cooks & or have smells must be about on the height floor, where vents starts around at. While pre-packed, not cooked, may be placed as low as they want. Yeah, I wish we can go outside but again, Federals.

## Level B7
Roig: Wow, how long we need to get there?

Zumi: (whisper) Psst, b14

Roig: (whisper) 😲😲😲?!?! so far!!

Zumi: I know. That one is the last I thought of after doing this mall.

Roig: Still gonna more?

Zumi: idk, I guess that's it. I think if I do more, I would reach mantle. hoof!, very hot!

Roig: Yeah, You got so many already. Maybe it's time to break?

Zumi: I guess.. 😏😏😏😏.

Roig: What's with that face.. and, is this floor empty?

Zumi: Don't be fooled by those whole area *Under Contrstruction* barriers. Those.. are something 😏😏😏.

Roig: Oh. Wow. Okay, let's..

Zumi: Obviously, you need to be biologically mature to access.. (found the entrace & soup hand point it) there. How do we do that? Simple, but atleast work. They see your being, and match the bio mature age on our database. *Homo sapiens* & similar is 18 years old, etc etc.

Roig: Alright, I would like visit that soon but uh, We go `Giant Truth` first.

Zumi: yeah, everything fun is in this floor. And btw, Littmann is sale here if you need a stethoscope.

Roig: Oh cool.. yess!!

Zumi: cardiophille heaven baby!

## Level B8
Roig: Hmmm this appears to be a fashion floor.. but uh... Oh my God, What??

Zumi: That's right! We got latex suits! & every fetish things! every kind you'd like to have here. Catsuit, zentai, BDSM, and toys about it, you name it.

Roig: Wow.. you got a pairs of *bedrock balls* or what?

Zumi: Yeah buddy, never seen mall that sells lewd stuffs? The only mall, only on Dasandim.

Roig: Okay, let's move on.

Zumi: Hey, no need to shy, I also like latex suit too. I know you like it, we all like it. Go get another some, these are all locally manufactured with rubbers from TexCity (Latex City). All Dasandim!!

Roig: Uhh okay.

Zumi: Hey, how many Latex suit collection you have?

Roig: 5. what?

Zumi: None of them are Dasandimians right?

Roig: Alright, you embarrased me in front of everyone, but FINE. Just get one to my house. and my ledger still dedd, I don't have powerbank.

Zumi: Easy, another birthday gift for you. But, which one you need?

Roig: Full Zentai breathable that one. I've been looking that for so long. I can only find suffocate at that time I explore couple months ago.

Rumiri Tulandrak (female Tamashien): Yes, this one sir.

Roig: (spread out & examine) hmmm yess.

Rumiri: Version 2022, newest release!

Roig: Okay, uh.. size L pls?

Rumiri: Available.

Roig: Alright, can I test that?

Rumiri: No need, lot bacteria! let me scan (holographically scan Roig's body)... (size found) Okay, it's L. (pickup L size still in packaging wrap)... Here L size.

Roig: Cost?

Rumiri: 450 Kvz, sir.

Roig: Right, lemme see the brand.. `Hymatt`. okay..

Rumiri: Dr. Hymatt fashion brand! top cher!!

Roig: This gotta be import right?

Rumiri: Only the name, the trademark & manufacturing for this model is here Dasandim. TexCity.

Roig: Right.. uh.. Zumi?

Zumi: Right, happy late birthday once again (take out phone, open camera).

Rumiri: (checked out, QR code ready)!

Zumi: (scan QR code), (pay)! Ahei, deliver this to his home please. here's the address, Roig?

Roig: Okay.. (type Address) Dimension.. junk division... exact coord.. (apply) okay.

Rumiri: Thank you! mmwah! 😘

Zumi: You're welcome. (continue walking)

JOELwindows7: Reminder! There are Zumi, Roig, Bladewire, Roig's mom, Roig's dad. Oh yeah lol. The pattern is trade center. me & family goes to trade center sometimes to find things, ITC Cempaka Mas, Tanah Abang, whatever it is. And that's how it looks like.

## Level B9
Roig: Hmmm, it appears alotta mixed assorted here.

Zumi: Okay, I dug more yess. idk what this floor would be for. Maybe in case customer came from this floor, perhaps introduce them a little bit about our mall. idk.

Roig: (Ponder the demo toys, appliances, everything exposed in every counter)...

## Level B10
Roig: Alright this floor is full of cars. And oh, they test drive those cars inside?!?

JOELwindows7: yet it's empty like nothing. only sales people. People around here doesn't like EV. Only few likes.

Zumi: Don't worry, all of them are electric.

Roig: Wheuh! imagine lots of smoke here.

Zumi: Yep. That's why.

Quentzal Lapim (car salesman): Hey, boy! try IONIQ 5 here! (to Zumi) Sir?

Roig: What's special?

Quentzal: idk, it looks like a DeLorean from South Korea, Earth.

Roig: Damn, you don't know how to sell car do you? Fine. Do myself (get in the car, at right which is driver seat).

JOELwindows7: Dasandim steering is on right. just my nation (Indonesia) and others (UK, Malaysia, Japan, Singapore, Australia, etc.), we drive on left. Also in Dasandim, salesman are not expert in marketing & clickbait. it's culture here for potential customer to try themselves, not hear from marketer.

Mulyono: (sit on front passenger left)

Dinda: (sit on back passenger left)

Zumi: (sit on back passenger right) Ah yess. wow, this is not bad, shame, the seat is not cloth.

Roig: Guess it's better like this. What if you spilled something?

Zumi: Alright, you got a point. (find adjust seat forward backward button) Oh, wow, the back seat is also electrical? Yeah!

Roig: Well, the back also can finally say goodbye to funny momentum when adjusting forward backward of the seat. Very neat!

Zumi: (noticed seat warmer selection button next to the power window adjust) The seat warmer.

Roig: Hey, I think this was how that 3D printer measured that dashclushter. He went all the way to here.

Zumi: Yep. He did. brought his meter (measurement tape) to here. measure also angles, whatever it is.

Roig: hmm How do they brought cars to here?

Zumi: Tunnels. there is parking tower beside this, accessible through car tunnels.

Roig: What is that?

Quentzal (bg async communicate 0): HEY! Try IONIQ 5 here! loh.. hey, this is the best car! C'mon!

Johnny Candlelight (bg async communicate 0): NO! EV sucks!! I want real car!! Not these toys!

Quentzal (bg async communicate 0): There is no ice (ICE, Internal Combustion Engine) here!!!

Johnny (bg async communicate 0): Then'll I'll find somewhere else.

Zumi: Boring Company, but it's Dasandim. Dasandimian likes to dig down. also left right front back, wherever. Houses must also dig down, no up. max 2 up, I mean 1 higher floor, but down as deep as you want.

Roig: Wow.

Zumi: hey, speaking of IONIQ 5, I heard a couple weeks ago, Wakturia chose a car. You know, some employees volunteered the testing, there are Teslas, a Volvo, and this Hyundai. many volunteer chose Tesla, Model X Plaid of course, no hesitate..

Roig: Okay.

Zumi: Only one chose Volvo XC90. I really clarity, it was Grevor's family. Yep, Misfortune. Obviously Swedish way choice.

Roig: Uh hem.

Zumi: Aand.. Latsufir. he carefully analyzed each car. seen S, 3, X, Y, and even CyberTruck. He doesn't like it.

Roig: wait what?

Zumi: The interface & UX is pecking strange to him. I mean yeah, Plaid has turn signal as touch button. He's appalled, lots of electric car too strange. Then Yume.. suggested, .. either.. Volvo, or this.

Roig: Then?

Zumi: He choose this.

Roig: Oh why?

Zumi: Because that [Volvo XC90 Recharge is **hybrid**](). I mean, it had somekind purposed of combustion engines idk how Volvo would use that. Also.. one already chose it.

Roig: Well, which reason prevalent? I complain hybrid.

Zumi: Same. Latsufir hates combustion engine. And it felt forced honestly. I can see from the video, his face. etc.

Roig: mmm

Zumi: The worst car ever. They only viable choice available at that time. 2 rows of seater only, imagine. How do you supposed to fit all family just by 4. You know you got grandpa, grandma, 2 pair both mom and dad side. Man!, 4 seater only. That's not family number. Where else the rest would have to sitt?

Roig: Yeah..

Zumi: But turns out, there's a bright side.

Roig: What is it?

Zumi: Sky is also come in. all spouse or potential must also come in for those volunteered. must include into couple if available yess.

Roig: So..

Zumi: Sky fell in *love*. Idk why. She just.. likes it. So okay then. If that makes her happy, Latsufir no longer care but just chose it for her.

Roig: mmmm I see. That's really wholesome.

Zumi: Well, that car, like this show here is still prototype though. Earth people & even Hyundai themselves called it complete in this version, very weird.

Roig: What's going on?

Zumi: See beyond that Dashcluster there.

Roig: It's nothing.

Zumi: No hologram. Dasandim government imported the car from Cikarang, Indonesia, Earth. Much cheaper than other parts of Earth. There is manufacturer for this model in Indonesia and that's where they got it from. And it happens to lacks lots of features.

Roig: Okay. that's disappointing.

Zumi: look the side view mirror.

Roig: (look), mmm nothing special.

Zumi: No digital side view mirror but still has surround 360 deg camera. That digital side view mirror is only available on Korea right now. just.. Korea.

Roig: Ouch!

Zumi: Well, many people here doesn't like digital side view mirror. Now look at keyfob put in the cupholder island.

Roig: (take a look), okay. (examine)... what's missing?

Zumi: No Remote Parking Assist. You were supposed to be able to push the car out or in just from the keyfob. Nope, Indonesia version doesn't have it.

Roig: oh man. this is infuriating. What else?

Zumi: No DisplayPort IN, no HDMI IN. just that USB-A for Android Auto & Apple Car Play. yep, only your phone (Fairphone 4, is Android hence Android Auto) can extend monitor to the dash. My phone (a Linux phone) can't. need DisplayPort USB-C.

JOELwindows7: Additionally, it lacks built-in dashcam (Korean), Digital Rearview center mirror ([will be fixed in 2023 revision, idk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UzDo_-w6eNg )), Back cold seat (only warm seat on back, only front has cold & warm seat), Solar panel (European & British non panoramic sunroof), Android Automotive (just basic heavily crippled Android for all Hyundai cars with that infotainment), DVB-T2 (Korea has DMB, the free digital TV service), etc.

Roig: Well.. if the car is bad, then why still choose it?

Zumi: I have no idea. I dislike to say just because it's made in Indonesia, and unfortunately it's the only reason. Yeah Kaorfa & other Indonesian apparently have been felt neglected by big companies for so long, therefore it's its own opportunity for Hyundai to build hype out of this. Made in Indonesia, newer than common been. Yeah, I can see it. lots of marketing about "Dibuat di Indonesia" alongside others stuff like that. that alone.

Roig: Wow, still Kaorfa & others felt it to this day?

Zumi: No possible fading as usual. anything made in Indonesia, is permanent hype starting point. that's it. And.. because it's lackluster severly, Dasandim Government forcedly has to modify the car by the time it's available. many things.

Roig: Okay. Great luck.

Zumi: Alright, let's move on.

## Level B12
Roig: Mmm, Department store.

Zumi: And groceries.

Roig: So wait, we gotta go this far?

Zumi: I know. many mothers park in this floor. Again, tunnels.

Roig: Okay.

## Level B13
Zumi: Right almost there. Bear with me. You tired yet?

Roig: Honestly yes.

Zumi: Hey, here I buy you drincc, over there. (go to drink stall)

Blotok Vanyar: Sir?

Zumi: `I'm Tired!!` pls.

Blotok: Okay, for all 5?

Zumi: Roig?

Roig: wait that's the drink name? uhh idk. whatever is that.

Blotok: You mean `I'm Tired!!` or `Whatever is that.`?

Roig: daf88!? Okay uh... `Whatever`.

Blotok: you two?

Mulyono: Uhh.. uhmmm.. hmmm

Blotok: Okay, `hmmmm...` you?

Dinda: gak tahu 🤷‍♀️..

Blotok: Right, `idk.`. Now, Bladewire. as usual?

Siru: Strawberry yess!!

Blotok: Okay, `As usual` (strawberry full). So the total are `I'm Tired`, `Whatever.`, `hmmmm...`, `idk.`, & `As usual`. for 30 Kvz is that correct?

Roig: Argh! I wish I got powerbank here!

Zumi: na na na! It's okay, Another... (open camera) birthday gift. (scan QR), (pay).

Blotok: Alright have a seat, in a few minutes.

(few minutes later).

*all*: (drincc bottoms up, I mean until finish)

Zumi: Okay so. It's time.

Blotok: Thancc & please come back.

Zumi: No problem.

Blotok: And hey, No federals.

Zumi: (look back) Definitely 😉. ... (look front & continue walk)

Roig: Okay, is this that tiny hallway?

Zumi: Well, this is one of the way. another more on the parking tower, for stuff deliveries. (walk)..

Feut Tion: Sir? (respect salute)

Zumi: My best friend is back. and here too his parents. time to introduce them what I've been doing really.

Feut: Yes sir. (unlock door & open roll door)! (come in hand pose)

*all*: (get in)

Feut: (close & lock side roll door)

Zumi: (press call lift going down button)

JOELwindows7: the lift is glass with metal frame for structural. this allows user to look around wide area around the `Giant Truth` & also phillosophy that we do not want to hide the *truth* no matter what happen.

Roig: Ah finally, lift!

Zumi: Yeah, because at this point, this is restricted area. No, not I don't want to share. I don't care if something got leaked. it'll be shared anyway. It's the federals.

Roig: Wheuh, I thought something nasty here!

Zumi: No, why would I? You'll quickly stress handling surprises and die young. My only stress is federals.

(lift arrived)

Zumi: Right, This is it. You first.

Roig: (get in)

Dinda: (get in)

Mulyono: (get in)

Zumi: (look around).... Okay. (get in), (press B14), (press close door now) careful, you might wanna hold on to bars now.

(lift goes down fast in acceleration)

Roig: Whoawoawoa! (hold) Whoah!

Dinda & Mulyono: (also hold bar)

Roig: Man, never feel lifts this fast!

Zumi: Don't worry, not as much as fastest one on Earth though.

## Level B14 THIS IS IT!! THE GIANT TRUTH
Roig: Whoah!!!

Zumi: Yep, here it is. but not done yet. more inside.

Roig: More?!

Zumi: Yep!

(lift arrive)

Roig: (get out of lift)!

*all*: (get out one by one)..

Roig: Okay. that's the gate.

Zumi: One of them. c'mon. (walk towards)... ...

Roig: Wow, there's a minigate in this gate.

Zumi: Yeah. You see, it takes alot of energy to open big gate like that. So, I add mini gate. Because, if I don't need big open, why has to open all? after all, it's not secure doing that, so.. make it small!

Roig: Hah yeah, make sense

(giant light turns on with that loud Hollywood knocker)!!

Dinda: (async) (flinch)!

Mulyono: (async) (flinch)!

Roig: (async) HOAH!!! Jesus Christ! what the f888 was that loud wood shock?!

Zumi: Oh, sorry. I know.. that.

Roig: Dude!

Zumi: Yeah, the knocker. It's to tell that the light is on. if cannot, then it won't knock.

Roig: But why?

Zumi: Security reason. intimidate federals of course. also for safety, difficult of seeing has to know it's on. idk, but I believe everyone here has to know regardless of condition.

Roig: Alright. Now, here's the door. How do we get in?

Zumi: easy! there are 3. You need of course, ID card (scan ID card to NFC scanner).., and Right palm (scan right palm to reader).., finally.. the ledger. (scan phone NFC to the NFC scanner), To see your name, and verify you hold the Dasandim ID account.

Olbin sonson: (answer intercom) Yes, door guard. Sir? Do you want to open this door?

Zumi: `vent amogus` (`pin`, small door).

Olbin: Okay. (unlock door), (close intercom).

Zumi: (door unlocks) interview. 3 things, yess. Plus 1 if you count it. (open door), right, you first. Bladewire too. ... (checking around).. (get in), (close & lock door).

*all*: (get in)

## Giant Truth Hubway

Jallopy Ometamnasir: (driving the cartrain towards just accessed gate No. 5)... (arrive & engage handbrake), Yo!

Zumi: Sup, buddy.

Jallopy: Sir?

Zumi: Introducing, my best friend. finally back. and his parents too. this is how do they looks like.

Jallopy: Oh.. Ahei nice to meet you. Jallopy.

Roig: Roig.

Mulyono: Mulyono.

Dinda: Dinda.

Jallopy: Right, nice to meet you all..

Zumi: We had been together like this back when I was kid. It's time to show my truth.

Jallopy: Lab 1, Sir?

Zumi: What else if not?

Jallopy: No federals. (disengage handbrake), (switch gear to move other way forward), Hang on tight! (step gas pedal)..

Roig: I didn't see this huge, in matter of time? How old are you now?

Zumi: 19. Right now.

Roig: Oh that's right! wait, how long you built this?

Zumi: Takes me about 5 years. Honestly this is just the pipes right now, only 1 lab over there straight. the right turn I made house for workers to live and communicate jobs, left I think.. for other labs. That's what I thought of for now, can have change a bit later.

Roig: Okay. I thought, it should be maybe 30 years to done just this hallway.

Zumi: Well, we're lucky! Dasandimian contractors have experience, that includes speed.

Roig: Wow. okay.. Just impressive.

Zumi: Indeed.

Roig: So, why that big?

Zumi: idk if I would eventually need bigger things. go in and out, in any form, and maybe also include something that 😏😏😏 you know..

Roig: (recognize sparsdat activity) Oh, that's right! I get it.

Zumi: If things gone big (paywallism, proprietarism, & partialism been worse than ever), that's how do we ready.

Roig: Uh hem. alright then.

Jallopy: (close mini train crossing bridge to lab 1) Folks, we're arriving. check your belonging make sure nothing's left (enter crossing bridge)..

Zumi: Alright, people let's go (stand up)

*all but driver*: (standup)..

Jallopy: Okay here it is. Lab 1. (point to stair) Stair is there, great luck, God bless you. No federals. (reverse again to go to about middle of the hallway to door gate)

Zumi: Alright, thancc for getting us here, c'mon people.. (down the stair)

*all*: (follow)

Roig: Oh look, there's also the mini track on bottom.

Zumi: If the hallway is crowded, we won't use this, only for mini things that need to quickly go around here. We have mini train lifts & ramps along this walls here. (point to that) look.

(camera view that ramp & lift)

Zumi: ramp is something emergency or too crowd, lift for ease. that's all.

Roig: Wow, so comprehensive

Zumi: I thought these all, what else missing? I'll add it.

Roig: idk. Well, let's get in!

Zumi: Alright! (run to the mini door of lab 1), (scan ID card), (right palm scan), (phone scan).. (door unlocks, open)! C'mon, you first.

*all but bladewire*: (get in)..

Zumi: (get in) Okay.. C'mon in. we're done!

Siru: (still on guard mode) (slowly crawl in)... ... ... .. .. (got in)

## Lab 1 (Lab 0 I think is already on the top where we started? idk)

Zumi: Iyya! (close door)! (lock door).

Siru: (relax guard mode into casual, retract sword upon limbs). Yeah!!

Gorgam Harkman (Siru's husband): Oh hai! (hug Siru)!!..

Zumi: Right!.. Here is.. my `Truth`. You know, I love being sparsdator (pirate) here. But as you can see, games already used to. people stop being care because, we've lost! alot of reason & it's the fact, that compensation & purchase of other things are needed in order to make games. So.. We're done, dead. Luckily, which is unfortunately, we still have more. It is a big surprise to me honestly that there exist, Open Source GNU GPL projects that its binary are not free. Introducing.. the [`Factory`](https://github.com/Perkedel/Sparsdator ) (open curtain).

Roig: Oh.. wow!

Zumi: Go ahead! take a look! lots of things in here.

Roig: Okay.. which one aaa... (spotted a [module box](https://github.com/Perkedel/Kaded-fnf-mods/tree/stable/Admiral_Zumi/simple_dimple_Kade-LFM_port ))! (take hands on) Oh, what is this?

Tuir Feullun: It's a prototype. Proof of concept. Here as you can see, we've managed to port somebody's file that we found at [outstrange places](https://youtu.be/7GPmOYlUVLc ). If that's not us who preserve this, this treasure can be damaged irrecoverable. no archive could replicate the download system, so we gotta act. (demonstrate the Polymod LFM mod) Now, Here I start the application, btw I am one of the remote member of Wakturia contract 2022, (press Escape to go to mod menu) alright... (loaded, point at the mod) ah here is this. I make sure that thingy, look `Simple Dimple` is loaded. After done, I can just save and go back.

Roig: Interesting..

Tuir: (load freeplay).. Sorry this one takes long... (loaded) Oh so fast! Okay. Yeah lol, I got premium PC here, anyway so.. uh. we scroll down and look at this `SIMPLE DIMPLE` It's there. you got it. Note, that the song is not built-in of course. it's copyrighted song so we can't build that in, must be separated. .. and I better not to play this here either. DMCA federals can hear through headsets. (terminate app)

Roig: well. So, you got this only?

Tuir: Well for now. we will yoink port alot of stuffs this way. Idea was to bring Psyched stuffs to here, but maybe we should first take a look at some stuffs that built chaotically at that time due to lack of modding semantics. If you have one, feel free to tell me.. [Right here](https://github.com/Perkedel/Kaded-fnf-mods/issues/new?assignees=&labels=reupload_pls&template=reupload_pls.md&title=Reupload+pls%3A+reupload+%3Cmod+name%3F%3E ). If the stuff was demonstrated through video, send me the video link, if mod page, the mod page link, never the cloud link. We need to credit the maker.

JOELwindows7: I need to reflect that `Reupload Pls` template to not only reupload but also mod ports.

Roig: Okay, cool! I'll take a look at this. Okay, next.

(baker tray. sparsdat open source software)

Roig: (spot a [bunch of baker trays](https://github.com/Perkedel/Sparsdator/tree/main/.github/workflows )), (hands on kushview) what is this?

Spour Affernen: This is our sparsdator prototype. How it works we simply do this.. The [machine](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows ) over there will download the source code. then compile it & publish the results. Simple! Well, that machine is scale, the bigger one is still in Work in Progress. Yeah, we need help.

Roig: So um.. let's see (view kushview factory line program)... Ah.. yess.. Okay. Maybe perhaps for this one, you should try be on Windows. & try to access if the [cartridge](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions#jobsjob_idruns-on ) had Visual Studio or something. JUCE it up & then uhh compile the solution, stuff like that.

Spour: Oh.. oh wow.

Roig: Anything else?

Spour: There uh.. Dosit?

Dosit Affernen: We have Ardour, but it's difficult. Its instruction we find on internet uses Arch to get this done. Here's the program (handover programming script to Roig)

Roig: (examine).... uh hem... okay. There a guy who had a tools to get Arch-like experience work for Windows I heard. if not mistaken they're under the name of something like... [msys2](https://www.msys2.org/ ) or what have you.. idk. but that's the people. There is [distributors nearby here somewhere](https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/msys2 )!

Dosit: Oh! 

Roig: You should build strategy for that. try to attach one, and see if the machine can interact with it step by step like usual.

Dosit: Ahhh yes yes yess yess. Thancc you, thank you..

Zumi: Wow, Impressive. You know things too!

Roig: Yeah. No problem. This is fairly easy, but yeah it can be hard. UGH! those federals. Wait wait!! Dude!

Dosit: Yeah?

Roig: ***btw***, you don't have Arch all at once?, Windows & Msys is rather complicated, again I'm not sure if the machine can step and interact through here.

Dosit: Oh yeah, but.

Spour: We tried. We cannot find it on list. they don't have Arch cartridge. Just Ubuntu, macOS, & Windows.

Roig: Aw man.. Damn it!

Spour: But still, thancc for your help, we'll soon experiment with this strategy.

Roig: Yea, Great luck! God bless you.

Dosit: Hey, btw, this is one result we've manually baked out. check [this](https://github.com/Perkedel/Sparsdator/tree/main/Handmade ) out

Roig: It's empty.

Dosit: We will put some of the manual bake there. And will use those for reference later. In case we still fail, burnt, undercooked or what, there we put ripe one manually baked.

Roig: Okay.

Zumi: Hey, you should be here then. I think you can excel at this.

Roig: Yeah, Of course, if there's something here, I can help I guess..

Zumi: Well then.. ... (hug)!!!

Roig: Whoah, okay.

Zumi: Welcome back. ... Please don't die again.

Roig: I won't, (reply hug slowly)..

...

...

...

Zumi: (release hug). Right, so.. how's your home? is it dangerous?

Busetda: Oh peck! they're coming.

Tusuk: Save people first.

(one house)

Irun: rescuer! we gotta get out from here!

*all people in the house*: (into the escort)...

Irun: Go!!

*employees*: (start wrapping & moving items to portal)

Mojik: alright, check anymore else..

Nok Frin: (fire)!!

Mojik: HUOHH! PECK NECK (close portal)!! (draw riffle & shoot the scavenger)!!!

*background*: (startrescuers moving items & defending)

Tusuk: Alright, this is the last house...

Toseliem: Sir, I found a computer with racks in here.

Tusuk: This must be Roig's house. Move the computer first, as well as the harddisk!

Toseliem: Yes sir, (open portal at the wall upon the computer desk), (push away the computers, & NAS racks).. Okay.. I think that's all now..

(rocket proprelled grenade entered this house, slowmo oh sh88 moment), 💥💥💥💥(duar)!!

...

Tusuk: (try to stand up) ugh.. Argh.. Toseliem?!?!

Toseliem: eeghh... (stand up)..

Tusuk: `THROW EVERYTHING`!!!

Toseliem: (take out `throw everything` grenade), (pull pin)!, (stab to ground)!!

(the grenade is digging)...

Toseliem: (move away from about to be teleported area)..

Tusuk: (aim)...

Xhocle Frin: (aimed), (fire RPG now)!!

Tusuk: (fire)!

(bullet hit just launched still near launcher RPG), 💥💥💥💥💥💥💥💥💥💥 JEGERR!!!!!

...

Busetda: (quickly go to the scene)..

*rest of employees*: (also rush towards)..

Xhocle: ... ... (hands up)!..

Tusuk, Busetda, Toseliem, Mojik, Irun, etc.: (brutally headshot those scavengers to death, finish all ammo)!!!

Tusuk: Right, we got 5 hours before they awake. anything we miss?

(teleport grenade explodes)!! (entire house teleports to X0p1r4t3)!!!

(house arrives slidingly), ... (crash wall)!!

*rescued citizens* = whoah ha! (cover eyes from dust flying)

Roig: Huh, what was that?

Zumi: Stay here, I'll check the front. (immediately go to outside `giant truth`)!..

Tusuk: First, teleport these robber straight to jail. into the Justice dimension. (take out sticky teleport mine), (set to Justice jail), (attach & activate)!

*all rest employees*: (get all scavengers be teleported)!..

Tusuk: Let's see.. umm.. Okay. Just the walls here. Let's continue.

## Back to Giant Truth outside
Zumi: (open door).. (see around).. Okay, Roig's house.

Nondi Kompta (delivery guy): HEY!!! DON'T SHOOT!! HELP!!

Zumi: Huh? who's there? (go inside the sound source at thrown Roig's house)..

Nondi: HELP!!!

Zumi: (sound is on the basement door), (lift open the basement door)..

Nondi: AAAH!! PLEASE DON'T SHOOT!! TAKE IT, HERE (throw the package)!!

Zumi: (catch) Uoh!! Nondi?

Nondi: Huh, Admiral Zumi?

Zumi: What are you doing here?

Nondi: I am delivering package, under name of Roig Hermalansa, here house.

Zumi: Oh, the Latex suit. What happened?

Nondi: Scavengers, they came!

Zumi: Oh okay. I shouldn't have deliver that there. I'm sorry.

Nondi: It's okay, I've been like this before.

Zumi: No man, nobody shall get you there ever again. Until the robber got destroyed first.

Nondi: Okay, anything else?

Zumi: I think that's it.

Nondi: Okay, see you later..  (deploy portal), (enter portal go back to delivery center)!!

JOELwindows7: remember, robber scavengers can trace exact source where teleporter was deployed. it's not safe while the scavengers are approaching. Nondi has to teleport far away from target delivery first then run towards it, and after that, run away far from target and then teleport back.

## Back again at Level B14

Zumi: Including Roig's house, but others?

Tusuk: Oh that one..

Toseliem: Man, scavengers! This is why we gotta be very vigillant. Now they even got grenades here.

Zumi: Right, nobody dead right? Cool and good. (call heavy hauler).. Right, I'll also open this gate for a while. The houses are in Yellow line.

Tusuk: Yes, sir. Okay, people. let's go! (bring all the stuffs to new house)

Gonotskop Tukram (strong T Truck driver): (saw Roig's house)?.... Whoah..

Zumi: I know, sounds confusing to you. But hear me out. We just got bombed by an who?

Toseliem: an indestructible slime evil beast with RPG. 

Gonotskop: Hokey.. (draw the grabber crane hook)... (stop & reverse to scoop the house into the basket)..
