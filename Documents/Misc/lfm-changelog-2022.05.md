# [VS. SKY](https://gamebanana.com/mods/44555 ) IS PECKING BACK!!! NO PECKING WAY!!!
ONE MORE LEFT!!! **C'MON, YOU CAN DO THIS!** MUST ABLE!

If 3 of them came back, I will make new unique mods for Full Ass. We will **Workshop** that.

wait. this tenseer feels familiar. Coco (Pixar), got a term of comeback to alive, No this presley guy. Well, after all the struggles especially brought the real ancestor to truth state, Coco no longer tied with terms, and did he do, he exposes that the presley is fake ancestor, that guy poisoned real ancestor turns out, and the infamous song is actually personal song for real ancestor daughter in which actually is Coco's uh how many great? yeah grandma.

Now. for us. We planned to stop making mods and abandon FNF fandom entirely as FNF Full ass released, because I hate paywalled improved rendition. pecking hate this so much. That's my *term*. So to 🖕 *why you too?!?! can't great big games be $0?!?!??! I know, but seriously though..*, I set a plan in this contract that this contract ends the time Full Ass released. Whenever the date has been defined, it's that date. After the contract ends, all Wakturia workers must cease making & yoinking mods, archive unfinished jobs, and handover everything to Cleaners. These people then will port everything we've made so far to FNFFA Steam Workshop. That's it. no more, peck you all.

But then, things changes. Maybe I am too but hole. oh why maybe, if it is definitely? But how to not be one? Well, I found it.  
One day, some mods that were gone suddenly came back. first it was [Whitty](ttps://gamebanana.com/mods/44214 ), and then Sky today. That's how it changed my mind. I dehoisted my middle finger, and built `Kontraktua Majoris`. These trophy showcase, contains lost mods (`Protoglin Amexamlef`) that came back. We got 2 right now. Mid Fight Masses still awaiting. I hope they come too.

You can see now, this is the first time in my carreer I think, that I dehoisted middle finger upon softwares that got improvement version but paid. Only FNF that had this. rest of them (Synthfont, Phoenotopia, etc. all of them I found) yea you know. Idk, will I keep dehoisting even if MFM not come back? Right now I expect all 3 to fully dehoist middle finger, idk if this would change to better or worse, idk.

So there you have it. We hope MFM come back too so we can happilly live in peace.

Thought padded into Frameworks
## INTRO
Admiral Zumi Rufthar Leksicorn: Alright, [this](https://github.com/Perkedel/Kaded-fnf-mods/tree/sammer-woost/Admiral_Zumi ) is nice!! What do you think?

Pocingklik Normaz: Amazing!

Zumi: Yeah, I know, it's not perfect. No idea what to build more with, I'm still nervous to get more you know!

Pocingklik: I know. I just uh... Maybe you should try the other one. Remember we've heard there was one Amexamlef came back? Perhaps we can help gamers know there is new version, by porting legacy to here, how about that?

Zumi: Great idea!, well uh complicated. we gotta tell Gyouter about(interupted)

Nurb: (knock door)! ! !! Hey!

Zumi: Yes, (walk to the door) what is it?

Nurb: There's a new guest, sir. He claims to be your old best friend.

Zumi: Alright, is he dangerous?

Nurb: No weapon, except a Swiss Army Knife.

Zumi: Okay....... (going to door), (wait nvm, check laptop first) oh wait.. (close Tab with kemono), (close lid)!, (go to door), (open door), (see through balcony) where?

Nurb: There 👉 (point to new guess).

Zumi: (examine)... (wait a second)!.... (confirmed)!!!

Roig Hermalansa: Hello!

Zumi: (thought he was murdered) Roig?? ... (tear of moved by) ROIG??!

## SPLASH
Song play: SYBS - Bittersweet (YouTube Audio Library) (*because it is almost similar with AHiT's Blue rift song orchestraic edition. more on that later. this is something to do with Yolaine, Subcon relations, etc. etc. yep, Yolaine has young sister, and the song of subcon forest if you entered the second part of the forest, yeah the village.*)

reel of cryptic moments..

okay here's the logo..

ok that's it, stop. now to begin. 
## BEGIN
## X0p1r4t3 Eenvreensment palace
Zumi: (ran towards Roig).. hh hhh hh

*guards*: (follows and guard Zumi)

Zumi: (approached Roig 1 metre away, stop)!! Okay hold! Check impostorness.

Roig: ...

Zumi: Who is `Federal`?!

Roig: The guy that "*shot*" me?

Zumi: What is that *double quotation*?!

*guards*: (also went sus, draw riffle up)!!?

Roig: They bombed me.

Zumi: Wait, how you be here? Oh wait yess. My house exploded. but..

Roig: The bomb is teleporter. they throw my family away into an unknown junkyard dimension.

Zumi: ...

Roig: Brother, It's me. your best friend, same as it was. (remind good old days of drinking coconut water together while working) Do we have coconuts here? I think we are thirsty now.

Zumi: 😢😢😢😢😢..... (hug Roig as hard as possible)!!!! 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭 (absorbtion hiks)!!!

Roig: OHo... (reply arms wrap hug too)..

Zumi: (drop hug) Haaah! man, I ..... I don't... man... Thought I..

Roig: It's okay man. We no longer have federal, at least not in here.

Zumi: That's why I stayed man. This planet is the best!

Roig: Yeah.

Zumi: Come, let me show you my office.

Gunlik Sudur (guard): Sir, these (Roig's parents) too?

Zumi: Oh yeah pls! come here too! come come come. (escort Roig family to Zumi's office) Lets...

## Back to office again
Zumi: (open door), you first.

Roig: (got in)

Mulyono Hermalansa (dad): (got in)..

Dinda Mawar Sutjipto Hermalansa (mom): (got in)..

Zumi: Alright, soo... here's my office.

(camera b roll office)

Zumi: Not that much, but that's where I manage and observe things here. I got.. Well nothing tangible here currently. All in my PC. I've been doing.. people stuffs aaand.. umm [*sharing*](https://odysee.com/@X0P1R4T3-33NSVREENMNT-0FFICIAL:f ) stuffs.. layaa (like a good old days??? I guess)...

Roig: Wow. You've got.. things that lost.

Zumi: Yeah, I.. hear people. things got lost, I hate losses. Also, other things.

Roig: Wait so.. where's ISO, eeh Crack gen, Keygen, and uh everything?

Zumi: umm uh that..

Roig: Whoah, don't say you stopped man. To this day, developers still paywall games and softwares. Why quit like that?

Zumi: Well uuhh, After been doing this.. I feel like, something so tedious here. Something really sus too. Like I have to usually, uh install the softwares, put a patched exe in it or have keygen, etc. etc., and uh.. I got bored. Also, I've noticed these days games gets updated, and uh.. pirates will be rechallenged again, because updates only comes for legit. I then curious.

Roig: 🤨...

Zumi: I know, call me insane, or traitor. I ask dad, credit card. just.. just once. ANd guess that whoahow, it's not that bad. [Steam](https://steampowered.com/ ), btw.., I guess... I am addicted, .. leuuuh... I'm sorry.

Roig: 😦????? So... Hey, remember. There's Adobe still here. Okay, no Adobe, we got GIMP. But in general.. We atleast have tools to come to here! Haven't you heard, `Free` means `Bebas`. *Libre* not price. Therefore, some open source app has paywalled binaries too! You don't know?

Zumi: ...

Roig: Okay, hear me out. I seriously disappointed with you, brother. You quit like that while paywallism pandemics still not stopping at all. Where are you going now? You don't do anything? All you do is sit here aand.. giving food on tables for those crackhead who makes us poor?!

Zumi: Uh, dude. It's complicated. At least I still hate Digital Restriction Management, right?

Roig: Oh man. I believe I lost my only best friend in my life. You no longer sparsdat games.

Zumi: (start *reveal* giant truth) Okay, fine. let's stop. Did I just played your emotion?

Roig: What do you mean?

Zumi: 😏... just wanna know, or really want to know?

Roig: 🤨...?

Zumi: (preparing to go to *giant truth* basement) You know, sparsdating software takes effort. We said it right?

Roig: Oh yeah, I remember.

Zumi: Since games paywallism becomes *endemic* and no longer possible to destroy, We still have things to take.

Roig: Oh.. Okay.

Zumi: (notify Bladewire with chat app)! You just said. Not all open source app have $0 binary.

Roig: Uh hm.

Zumi: (still preparing defense weapons) I have begun to start again my journey, after I find that.. there is a gray area, .. that I can exploit (insert magazine to handgun), thanks to GNU GPL or whatever.. (put handgun to holster). And that's... How not to pay for tools.

Roig: Oh. and this we're going?

Zumi: (look right to door)..

Pocingklik: (knock door)! ! ! Sir?

Zumi: Bring her in.

Pocingklik: (open door), Sir, Bladewire.

Siru Magomalen: Yessir!

Zumi: Greeting. Here's my best friend and his family. Today, we going to the `Giant Truth`.

Siru: yessir.

Zumi: Remember as usual, This is confidential, I mean no (Paywallist) Federals shall know this. I want you to guard us while we're going there.

Siru: Oy (overreact respect pose) yess sir!!

Zumi: Right, let's get going. (start going altogether)

Siru: (began her super agile lightspeed guarding mode & draw swords from hands & legs)!.. (lightspeed here)!, (lightspeed move there)!!..

Roig: Alright, So.. what casual things you do here?

Zumi: Well, we got so many people down there. Many of them are like me, immigrants from various galaxies. Sure, we live well, do jobs, many jobs. not just technologies but also foods, etc. Basically, it's a town. Or maybe a city, been so multi-level of residence here.

Roig: Oh, I thought it's just a secure castle thingy.

Zumi: No, not just that. We put people inside grounds. Much safer than poking out.

Roig: That make sense.

Zumi: And one of the door is right there (point to swing double gate door)?

Lodim (right door guard): (respect pose) Sir?

Moldim (left door guard): (unlock door)...

Roig: Oh, using warehouse door? can car fit in? what about trucks?

Zumi: Well, we got another entrance outside, big one, thick one.

Roig: Alright. there's one inside too?

Zumi: (point to behind) Yeah, there.

Roig: (look behind) Oh. didn't see that. yeah this yard so big, yet empty.

Zumi: We used to put trading spots here, foods I remember, but after hearing news about Federal crackdown somewhere in galaxies, I can't afford to risk people lives anymore. so.. that's all & strict it out (keep them inside & only accept no guest who are Paywallist Federal loyalist).

Roig: hmmm, alright.

Moldim: (unlocked) Door open, sir.

Zumi: Thanks, buddy. (go in altogether)

## X0p1r4t3 City. Level B1
(Zumi, Roig, & Roig's parents got in).

Moldim: (close & lock door again)

Zumi: Alright, to the Giant Truth. follow me, (continue walk) it's crowding here.

Roig: Wow, markets.

Zumi: Yeah, people trades things. Here you can see..

(view trading moments of those markets)

Zumi: people are trading junks. Of course, something we can recycle just like DIY scrap build YouTubers. And we also got.. Electronics. Lots of Arduino boards here, & its related components, very interesting, you should collect them all and maybe recollect the same components coz you never be enough. (found stair & point to that stair) This way (go to stair down).

## Level B2
Roig: MMh! wow, this smells familiar. that car scraps.

Zumi: Yep, automotives. components like engines, alternators, batteries, entertainments, speakers, etc. etc.

Roig: Is there floatation module?

Zumi: Of course there is. Recently that's went viral couple weeks ago. I heard they use a natural stone called `Zerzek` because people here plays [Zerahypt](http://zerahypt.net/ ). but I think it doesn't seems one. Because scientists that discovered it in 2017 avoided that presumably but unconfirmed proprietary trademark name, so we called it.. um what is it?.. Ah! `Venemos`. like its planet name famous for having that stone, `Venemosa`. Very close to Uredith's planet.

Roig: (stop awhile since spotted something) Oh look, is that 3D printed IONIQ 5 dashcluster casing?

Zumi: Oh yeah. uh..

Mudus Untal: Oh! Sir?

Zumi: Hey!

Mudus: Hey look, I've attempted CADding this myself. In case somebody needs replacement, and Hyundai is not in Dasandim at the moment.

Zumi: Wow. Impressive.

Mudus: Thancc, sir! Well uh, I just estimate it. this gonna be incorrect size. I tried to [find](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=hyundai+ioniq+5+3d+model+free&t=brave&ia=web ) everything but [uh](https://sketchfab.com/3d-models/hyundai-ioniq-5-2022-53f1b0e8d2e4473ab543b7f0c67a258a ).. [unnggggh](https://sketchfab.com/3d-models/hyundai-ioniq-5-2022-80e8a085fe774737be9825adfc83bfbd ).. [aan](https://www.3dcadbrowser.com/3d-model/hyundai-ioniq-5-2022 ).. yeah, did not look good. I got [another](https://3dwarehouse.sketchup.com/model/b46ef9dd-2f75-4d0b-9415-9a993f59b286/2022-Hyundai-IONIQ-5?hl=en ) but.. uh I think all of the dashboard is incorrect, and none sometimes.

Zumi: Don't worry, brother. We'll figure this out. zero one four three.

Mudus: yeeahh 😞😞😞😞.

Zumi: Right, see you later. keep going man. that's great modelling.

Mudus: Thanks again, man.

Zumi: (continue walking) no problem. (point to down stair)!

## Level B3
Roig: Right, so, why not use lift in here? Do you have lift here?

Zumi: We have so many actually.

Roig: Why don't use them?

Zumi: Uhhh..

Roig: Don't dare you say that's just because you want to show something else first to me, you market head!

Zumi: Okay, I'm sorry, Yeah, you're right. (look & point with open soup hand at lift crowds over there) But as you can see, everyday, not to mention national holiday, lifts are always crowded.

Roig: 😐😐😐😐😐

Zumi: Want it balcon there, or stuffs lift (good lift) that is larger. No hope. We got lots of things to be delivered, from around galaxies, aand for that.. people of galaxies is not so different. We hate walking on stairs.

Roig: Heeeh. that's... a natural excuse.

Zumi: Honestly can be said so. (continue walk again)

(few metres later)...

Botlim Rooterdaam: Sir? (respect salute).. (saw Roig) Hey dude! want [Fairphone](https://www.fairphone.com/ )?

Roig: (reject what he think is a cheaply Chinese phone) ✋✋!

Zumi: (stop)

Roig: Hey, go on!

Zumi: I recommend you get yourself a new phone. I saw your phone is outdated.

Roig: Uh.. this is Samsung Galaxy A8+ 2018

Zumi: You must change now. that phone gonna *explode* soon.

Roig: Explode? wasn't that..

Zumi: No, you'll lose your data soon. It will suddenly die, no recoverable.

Roig: Man, it works fine..

Botlim: Hey man, I heard Kaorfa had phone like that. Suddenly *exploded*, I mean it's just dead, green screen, no turn on, and lost 100% all data. irrepairable. You should get Fairphone instead!

Roig: Made in China?

Botlim: But it's..

Roig: MMM NA!

Botlim: Hey, WAIT! hear me out! The workplace over there isn't like others. [It's the best!](https://www.fairphone.com/en/impact/good-working-conditions/ ). *They are people too*, they got wage, and whatever that maintain wellbeing something like that.

Roig: (start getting intrigued, go sit on the meatball chair upon the counter) Alright, ... (sitt) is it fast?

Botlim: It is! well uh.. not so fast, but sufficient. You play Genshin?

Roig: No, I'm not interested. What the hell gacha poops.

Botlim: Then, it's decent for you. And

Roig: And what? Why I'm sitting here? I supposed to (point with left hand open to neighbour Samsung dealer left beside by this counter) get Samsung Galaxy S22 Ultra.

Botlim: Whoahh, that's drastic. We imported that phone all the way from Earth to here. It gets more expensive now. How much is it again?

Setrum Rooterdam: Three Thousand Kivrontz (3000 Kvz, about IDR 30 Million).

Botlim: WHuuueh!! adds 1 thousand, bro! It supposedly 2000 Kvz (about IDR 20 Million).

Roig: 🤨🤨🤨, I mean, that Fairphone is imported from China, which also is Earth too isn't it?

Botlim: Well, something special about Fairphone, it's subsidized, because.. it's repairable plus kindnesses there of course. Only for 750 Kvz. Originally 1200 Kvz.

Roig: Alright, lemme try. This time. I don't have time here, Zumi wants me to upgrade now, because this phone here.. is from 2018. Pretty old quick huh?

Botlim: Yeah. aand.. it's intentional. They want you to buy new phone. **Planned Obsolesence**, you know. And btw, Buying Samsung here, is stupid. I could not find service center here in Dasandim, neither Fairphone, but only Fairphone that encourage you to.. 😏😏 (whistle suiit, suiit), 😘😘! You know what I mean?

Roig: Alright. speaking of Rule 34 (nake her body a.k.a. self repair), you got sparepart too?

Botlim: Of course we have! lots of tentants here sells 'em! check 'em out!

Roig: hmmf, okay.

Botlim: Right, you must be want.. [Fairphone 4](https://shop.fairphone.com/en/ ). (show & handover demo unit) This one is the best.

Roig: (examine the unit) hmm... wait. Where's headphone jack? it's gone too??!

Botlim: Yeah, Fairphone since 4 removes it.

Roig: AH! f8888 hell. They too?

Botlim: Well, We also sell Razer headphones, cabled too..

Roig: Because I know, wireless sucks! lots of latencies.

Botlim: Which is why, exclusive for this mall, we got this (put on the table..) soundcard, absolutely free. it also has passthrough for charger USB-C port.

Roig: Alright, I guess. Just.. very disappointed.

Botlim: Well, you might not want to, because, this sound card is even better than if it is built in. Audiophile approved. I know you want not just enough, don't you?

Roig: Yeah, I guess it's time.. for days of d8888.

Botlim: 🤣🤣🤣🤣!!! Right, we deal about this? 750 Kvz.

Roig: Alright, let me wallet (take out phone & open Kivrontz wallet app)

Botlim: Oh that's alright, you better transfer data first..

Zumi: No no no, I just buy it for him. You're welcome buddy.

Roig: No no, no need. I have 30000 Kvz, Just lemme do it. Let me transfer data first. (began transfer data), (prepare USB flashdisk), (login Gmail & setup new phone)..

Botlim: (prepared EDC to the counter glass table). Okay, fill your name here, and whenever you ready, scan in the checkout.

Roig: Looks nothing, just contacts, good.

Botlim: Wow, dude, where's your photo?

Roig: Saved on computer, I don't do much photo, I download *homeworks* mostly to my computer. There's nothing instagramable other than scrap metals.

Botlim: Ouhh, sorry kids. You mean.. the federals?

Roig: How do you know?

Botlim: (head swing back to point at Setrum)

Setrum: (upset of remembering the incident)

Botlim: Thank God, he's here. whew, I hate paywallist federals.

Roig: Okay, I think that's it. idk what else. Time to checkout (press multitask menu, go back to Kivrontz app window), Seven fifty Kivrontz.. (scan QR).. (success), Okay. let's do this. (press pay). ... (failed) huh? umm hold on.

Botlim: Reception here is good? wanna WiFi?

Roig: Okay, password?

Botlim: `LetusLukararim9`. L all caps, no space.

Roig: (show typed password) Like this?

Botlim: Yeah.

Roig: ookay.. (go back to Kivrontz app)... Try again. (scan QR), and... (press pay).... (failed). Oh c'mon.

Botlim: Well, maybe memory leak. restart your phone?

Roig: Yeah, that's what I'll do. (Hold power until power off window appear), (press restart).

Botlim: ...

Zumi: ...

Roig: ... ... ... (phone turns on but green screen and that's it) Huh wait what the hell?

Botlim: What? lemme see..

Roig: (put the phone)

Botlim: OOOOOOOOOOoooooouuwwwh..

Roig: Uuuhhh, no...

Botlim: I'm sorry man. Looks like your phone finally *exploded*. duar.

Roig: Wait.. It can't be! (force shutdown old phone by pressing power longer until it's off), Charger pls!

Botlim: Okay (give USB-C end to Roig).

Roig: (connect).. ... .... ... (still not turn on at all with charging status) uh..

Botlim: Yeeeeah.. he's dead. And you're lucky. Right after you've transfered everything. Kaorfa.. well not at all. lost everything.

Roig: 😐😐😐😐😐😐

Botlim: And look, in case there still something left in it, it's impossible. nobody can extract the data to this day if it is Samsung. Even other 3rd party repairs, they can't. Maybe you wanna sell the parts here?

Roig: No, of course not!

Botlim: Okay. After all I don't want too.

Roig: (ponder his new phone with scepticism upon this unexpected quest)....

Zumi: Okay, Should I..

Roig: No no, let me take my ledger (take out crypto ledger).. (press scan fingerprint with right thumb to unlock)... uh.. it's dead. battery dead. um, My private key copy is in my home. I don't have cash.

Zumi: Well, forget about it. (take out phone & scan QR) Did you missed birthday gift months ago?

Roig: I don't get big gifts, My dad makes things for me.

Zumi: Well, time for a best friend to gift once again. (press pay)!

Roig: Okay, thancc. I really want that S22 Ultra though..

Zumi: But..

Roig: I see.

Botlim: Well, great luck! If you need help here, you can just contact me. (give physical business card).

Roig: (take & examine card)... (store in pocket).

Zumi: Right, great luck with your new phone! let's continue (continue walk)..

JOELwindows7: The parents are still silent, I know.

## Level B4
Zumi: Hey, do you have arcade in your house? I mean, in your junkyard?

Roig: I do have, but they are such an old retrotech stuffs. Mostly used items thrown away, people repaired it.

Zumi: Well, you can see now, we got newer tech powered arcades here, even the classic ones ike Pinball, those have new techs in it.

Roig: Wow.

Zumi: Well, if you'd like to play, this is the place. You can use your ledger to save data & upload to your cloud. That's right, only needs your ID card. If you want to register your Dasandimian citizenship, there's the office, (point to the Immigration Registration Center) right there. Everything, ID, crypto, passport, there, all in one. Just that, ready to use. Even play arcade right now, exchange money too there.

Roig: HOH! So easy!!

Zumi: Yeah, king Dasan (& Queen Andim) wants to have friends & families. And other else, it's been so hard to register to a nation. Therefore why not make it so easy as signing up on a website & start uploading stuff da right now.

Roig: Well... I guess I have to explore more about Dasandim, what the hell is this planet?

Zumi: Alot! Can't explain in particular even.

JOELwindows7: Hmm, okay hear me out, Roig had Kivrontz wallet. You know, Kivrontz wallet is part of the Dasandim citizenship, yes that Social Seucity Number. He has been a Dasandimian technically, but Roig didn't knew this yet, because only Dasandim tightly integrate cryptocurrency as a nationwide currency & as well as other things that makes All in One User account, is that.

Pottum Nodt: (press B4 button on vending machine), (scan NFC with ledger), (take just fallen drink bottle out of caddy), (open cap), (drincc right away)!!!

# Level B5
Roig: (downed a stair).. Hey, btw, Why don't we use escalator here?

Zumi: (eyes on the crowding escalator) Well just look at that.

Roig: Oh.. my God.

Zumi: People really hates to use leg just to get there. Lifts already full, and now escalator.

Roig: Then why not make stairs fun? like.. add some interactables stuff like that..

Zumi: People got bored. And many of them are not interested.

Roig: Yeeeuh!

Zumi: Remember, they are (racism warn hoisted).. forget about this.

Roig: (knew this is racist) Yeah, don't talk this.

Denf (game disc seller): Steam key, for cheap! Limited stock!

## Level B6
Roig: Wow, this one is.. long.

Zumi: Because this floor is for physical arcades & amusements basically. Roller Coaster, Bom bom car (Bumper car), Ice skate, roller skate, simulators, whatever rides.

Roig: Okay, that usually should be on the Ground level.

Zumi: Yeah.. we are lazy, me & customers. Lazy to move the intruments to here, lazy to down just to get here, lazy to... to move it again. and uh.. Didn't know when to stop digging, in fact, this was lowest level, but then yeah. Don't worry though, we already have thought of those reinforcements here and there.

Roig: Alright, hope not collapse.
