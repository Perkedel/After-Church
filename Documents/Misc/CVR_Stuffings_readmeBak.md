## Additional Info

### GUID

Ensure to detach the GUID if you'd like to make new variant of these prefabs.

For employee: **DO NOT LOSE THE GUID!! MAKE SURE IT IS STILL ATTACHED, & IS SAME MATCH WITH THE PAGE IT UPLOADED TO!**

### Are these done by Realizer division?

Not officially. Although some Realizer members had involved, still it was done by serveral other volunteers at Perkedel Technologies who worked with this in their free time.

Due to different settings and goal with the game engine CVR used, There is no dedicated division handling content creation for this social media. So, Ricitello, **PECK YOU!!**

### Weren't you supposed to make your own Godot social media?

Creating social media on its own is huge responsibilities. It is not a simple hassle and burdens to take. While the server will be as neutral as possible & dev themselves may not, these days, neutrality is a necessity. Or let's say, **siding a necessity**, in which **it is required to ban people on certain opinion sets** in favour of bigger threats that must be obeyed, in order to legally operate, among other things.

Although, VR Sandbox can still be possible, **BUT** without the social media capability. It won't be GodotChat. **Meja** (Open Source Tabletop simulator clone). More like industrial physics simulation framework.

This **Kantor 369 Meja** is one that will officially be built by Realizers. Later.

### Dippy's Unity Packages ~~GONE 404~~ EXISTS

~~We are no longer able to find his Gumroad whatsoever. However worry not, because we have claimed those items before these disappearances. Further creation shall use these items yoinked or the reuploads. Only things we worry are the other files that may have not been claimed, who knows.~~ We found it https://dippythefoxderg.gumroad.com/ . Please refer to these files for more informations.
