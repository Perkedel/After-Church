# One day, Anti Defamation Law JP style would apply in Dasandim.

Because once upon a time in future, there were rampant exposé everywhere that makes reputation beyond recovery. Dasandim government unfortunately must accept this pull request of the new bill just to curb reputation genocide. Until the true Forgive was discovered.

The bill says, reputation either bad or good alignment will survive. Those who seek destruction subjects to severe punishment, even if it was the good people who exposing the bad person. The bill extradites across galaxies

- Koros Sceptor angery as he found a pull request like this to be accepted
- call all involved in this pull request
- contributor explains that there has been numerous amount of exposé. 62 times over the past few year. Despite being told to solve sensitive problem family way, the victim shared the issue to social media anyways, destroying offender's reputation beyond recovery. Some of the offender then killed themselves. The projection says that this will keep going.
- koros disagree, told contributor to punish victims & educate
- all agents unfortunately outnumbered by the exposé lovers. More to manifest and non-stop
- Koro gave up . Beings. They just like revenge, don't they, cease to look the other side of consequences really.
- assistant. You need to drink juice? Or perhaps an entertainment park
- Koros angrily leave room.
- next day
- President review & approve & reject pull requests. Passed this controvercial ones.
- President to reject, but assistant interupt reexplaining what contributor had said yesterday.
- What if we leave them like that?
- assistant reply there is nothing anymore can you do, other than to just die. Worst case scenario it is.
- President start shaking in traumatic war fear, ghostly thoughts of "pls forgive me" beggings flies around mind
- assistant continued oh maybe the best scenario unfortunately. In reality, the contributor had experiment trying to find job these offenders could do. It works for another year, but the disguise always gets reexposed again months later. Like they're just a cancer cell must be killed.
- President even shakes more. 
- about to sign, but Koros is here in the stage.
- assistant We have explained the same to him. He unfortunately also has to agree, he did.
- delay
- president hastily sign & approve, hastily put pen to dock, exhausted bow on that chair.
- assistant. From now on, reputation both a good & bad people shall prevail. Any form of destruction subjects for compensation and destroyers both good & bad alignments will be punished.
- Assistant. You need drink juice? Perhaps an entertainment park
- President leave parliament stage, go back to sedan. Go home. Fall to bed hastily, letting suit bit messy. Contemplate what has he done but also an unfortunate desperation and for everyone's life that will get lost everyday if he didn't approve.
- offenders immigrates to Dasandim & gets job & fun as if they are a normal people. There are already 100 more reexposers punished, but also 100 more offenders who refuses to repent gets punished. The suicide rate significantly goes down drastically, but this is still unsatisfiable & dangerous idea.

## Other rules in part of this Dark Age Law

- Blocking People. Blocking victim no matter what will be *protected*. Those who blocked, will be arrested temporarily to be investigated. When the victim is a spam scammer, they will be free & the spam scammer will be further hunted down. Otherwise, they will be held & further punished accordingly. Yes, sometimes it's the abuser the victim of blocked, but law enforcements will try their best to make sure the abuser *protection* to be removed & transfered to the blocker instead. However it's not that easy, because both party will be checked rigorously, and law enforcement are trained to protect the blocked victim, e.g. for simple discomfort, will not constitute the worth reason of blocking, hence the blocker will still be punished.
- Dislikes. Disliking assets will get you prisoned & worse to be punished further. Although, law enforcement are still need to make sure the bombardment is worthy only on bad videos, such as spam, scam, and any dangerously misleading lifehacks. Terrible, tin can, & unquality if does not contain such danger are not worth disliking. Additionally, website administrator must disable the dislike button (not just hide count), and only enable it if the video and assets is bad.
- Tracking. Optional Package. If things gets worse, website administrator then are required to install invasive tracker to track & arrest offending people. The chances for this package to be activated is one out of googol, but never zero. Once it activates, all customers & business must share their real time location so police can arrest those according to their crime, as soon as possible.
- Lolicon. Fictional Loli is very different, normal, & is considered different. Domain registry & website admins must allow lolicon both NSFW & SFW while still forbidding that other act real life, except for private & hidden police investigation to capture that bad actor doing that real life bad things. Those who censors fictional lolicon any form whatsoever are considered unable to differentiate between real life & fictional & the punishment can be severe such as business license revocation, & even imprisonment like other crimes specifically oppression of freedom of expression. And combined with tracking above, domain registry & website admin must collect private user location which police can use to hunt & arrest anyone that dare to oppress this lolicon right. Yes, both domain registrar members location, Website admin, & their customers. It is intentional, because it is very rampant on Earth.
- Prison. Since building more prison is inefficient, tight, & stressful, arrests now are in each owner's home. The prison will be used for more severe crime. For homeless criminals, they will be arrested to the house complex next to the prison. How did they homeless in Dasandim btw? It's impossible, thanks to Isolatip subsidy program. Oh that's right, nomads! Car homes! Their car will be locked in the special prison RV park.
- The UBI will be boosted if they didn't do harrass neutral opinions for the next 6 months.
- Reporting system has been upgraded using super computer level of performance kit. Additionally, while powerful AI is used, only living beings allowed to execute the report, therefore algojo job vacancies is always available, even it is full on office. Hiring also available for work from home, with voting system, most agree on which, goes to execute or dismiss.
- If the any reporting system node ever fails, the captain handling that node will lose their salary for that month. It keeps this way, until it gets fixed then the salary return next month. UBI still won't die despite of this.
- Wakturia will be disbanded & all employees are transfered to the reporting workers to help AI handle the report like everyone workers. Yes, merged into workers. Kaorfa is fine to yoink copyrighted trademarks & franchises alone, although quality of yoink may be decreased significantly.
- Guns & Laser blaster will be banned, but hurtful airsoft won't be & be encouraged. training round gun (including hurtful rounds) won't be banned & encouraged also. Only law enforcements & military is allowed to have guns & laser blaster. No license sign up available to non-military & police. There is no speed limit for airsoft bullet at the moment, only making sure the target don't die after shot.
- Salary minimum will be nerfed 35%. though company that applies lesser minimum salary wages must occassionally bring huge THR for at least 5 times a year, each minimum 1000000 Kivrontz. If the company somehow unable to, then the government will do it, no credit / debt to the company. Just you can't. Of course, all freshly minted.
- child labor will be more banned than ever before. That doesn't mean mature Tamashien is not allowed to work. We're talking about less than 18 years old biologically. Punishment has been increased significantly, now 20 years prisonment & all money in wallet fined + no UBI. After the punishment finished, UBI will be restored immediately but start from tiny to normal.
- Companies whose employees are over 90% AI robots will get fund boost. This does not apply to reporting system since living being are prioritized.
- Prisoned criminals whose origin not Dasandim can still be claimed by their origin planet no fuss. origin planet are encouraged to punish the criminals accordingly, except death sentence.
