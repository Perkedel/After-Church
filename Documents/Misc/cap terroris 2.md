# Sloantim neighbour toxic

Couple weeks ago, a massacre was happened in planet Jiktova. The terrorist uses a data publicly set by user from our Dasandimian marriage index. In which the terrorist targets any LGBTQIAA marriage profiles. Because of this, we immediately closed down public view of marriage data both Verified (Straight) & 3rd party verified (LGBT). Only the family member can see the marriage.

Unfortunately, the war did not over. Yes, we won the court against Jiktovan defendants that acuses us for LGBTphobic genocide based on our marriage profile mentioned. But they refuse to stand down and band all of their mafia companies around the galaxies to attack us until our exhaustion.

Due to this, we have ordered Gravitational ship to move entire Dasandim system away from Sloantim.

For the record, yes we never verify LGBT marriage. But due to user request we allow 3rd party verifier that do the work.
