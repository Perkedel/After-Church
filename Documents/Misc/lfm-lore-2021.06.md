A new fork merge of part of the story has been coming. it's Friday Night Funkin. have a look.

# Begin
## Wakturia, Dasandim. 2021
Effendrim Machelan: (working on a computer in Mission Control Center)... (Receive new message) Oh, what's is this?

## Grevor's house, Dasandim.
Misfortune Ramirez Hernandez: Grevor, don't forget the powerbank!

Grevor Sritowi: Yes, honey! (equip exoskeleton) won't forget that! (install powerbank). power, caps (capacitor), sys (component board), Alright, (receive message, pick up phone)! What's is this? (read message).... Oh, new project.

Misfortune: Oh, a new project?

Grevor: Yes uh, new project. We got new fork. (continue reading)... It's going to be big.

Misfortune: which mean we're camping?

Grevor: Uh... no. It's interfaceable. Still access with interfacers. We are going together observe the merge of this fork to this universe. All families can look here. This gonna be fun!

Misfortune: wow! great luck! I think I can do something with it. May I?

Grevor: as always, yes. let's go!

## Wakturia
Gyouter Embinosa: (observing members around this control center room)... (Grevor & Misfortune arrived) Alright that's everyone. Okay. Welcome back. Today's fork is `Last Funkin Moments`, which is.. `Friday Night Funkin`. As usual, we're going to observe and protect the fork merging for the realm, to this universe here. and (anticipating Latsufir questions)...

Latsufir Umnaga: Description and Rule!

Gyouter Embinosa: That's right. `Last Funkin Moments` is a *mod* of `Friday Night Funkin`. let's just abbreviate to `LFM` & `FNF`, FNF is a rhythm game. to be exact, it's like Dance Dance Revolution / Stepmania. What's different, is player 1 on right, and player 2 on left. that second one is CPU, Non Playable only at the moment (vanilla). Semantic works like NanaOn-Sha's `Parappa`, which makes FNF typically a Simon says-like game but arrows. although sometimes it may deviate its semantic either small or large scale. As simple as that. Now, let me read the rule:

### Rules
#### Standard
- Always make sure elements to be contributed are Gratis, Open Source, and Full Version.
- Keep the Chaos and Order in their place. Avoid deviating drastically any events possible that can cause Oveone's proposition (Anti Climatic, silly edits, and just plain hasted storyline that would disappoint audiences).
- Follow the existing event that had already happened in the realm. The realm class already has an instance (from ninja_muffin99 and other modmakers), so we want us to only rely from that instance. Remember, this is not like Surreal Meme's culture (where there is no mainstream class instance officially, hence you make your own instance of lore).
- and... We have, bunch of special orders this time (worried emotion). Oum.. Okay.
#### Special Orders
https://gamebanana.com/threads/218927 Section 1

https://gamebanana.com/threads/219274 https://gamebanana.com/threads/219778

- an Embargo of 7th Week exclusivity in Newgrounds is on going. *DO NOT reupload week 7 except mods that changes week 7*. Okay. That's fishy.
- Make mods open source. AH what is this? that's easy. that's what we are, we know. and...
- This particular mod over the top has been deleted due to unforseen... chaos out of place ran by immature beings. Avoid any insertion and explicit reference towards her. Wow, (pull breath), This... Okay.

### done read rule
Gyouter: Right! that's all. any questions? ... ... Latsufir?

Latsufir: (peturbed face).. uh yeah?

Gyouter: um, do have any questions? you usually ask us questions. Like, Can I do this, and.. How about this.. stuff like that?

Latsufir: Um, no. I don't have one right now.

Gyouter: Okay, I know this is.. quite hostile I would say. BUt, we can do this. together, we can make the merge the better place. Promise.

Latsufir: I hope so.

Gyouter: right everyone, start working.

# Workening
Gyouter: Alright. Today, Kaorfa is going to make `Week Strong`. Boyfriend and families are going to Jakarta, Indonesia, Earth to visit the biggest convention center, `Jakarta Fair` which previously had canceled due to COVID-19 pandemic on earth. It says, somewhere after the herd immunity reached in Indonesia they're just bored and.. want to have a brand new adventure. It happened that they found this after someone on TikTok reshared the news and Boyfriend had stumbled upon it. Now, Important stuff being asked, what should we do here?

Latsufir: Wear mask!

Gyouter: Yes?

Latsufir: Do they have been vaccinated? okay nvm, I don't care. Wear mask! for the time being, COVID can somehow snuck **among us**. heck, they're now claimed to be endemic in that part of the Earth. We must make the maximum safety whereever you go, especially being outside and recently won over the pandemic. Standard survival tips. everybody knows that.

Gyouter: that's what I'm talking about.

Latsufir: and hey! uh.. do you remember Hookx, one of our prototype project? you know, our messenger robot, we disguised as a consumer electronic of Novelty Television that can turn its display. I think we can utilize this one for something in here.

Grevor: ah, yes. that portrait TV. and, unfortunately uh, we somehow failed to make the software works. I don't know, it works in our Devkit, but then when we put it on Hookx with the exact same architecture, it doesn't work at all. We still unable to figured that out so we scrapped it.

Gyouter: alright, what message you'd like to put there, Latsufir? Remember the special orders. We can't speak about Sky or Week 7 to there, otherwise we'll be *trashed* and that will destroy our Universe.

Latsufir: Yes I know. .... it's actually for our messages, and recent things going on in that realm. Our Motto, and the realm conditions. yes! 

Gyouter: Alright, Grevor? how do you gonna make this work?

Grevor: uuhhhh let me think...

Latsufir: **🙋‍♂️ I KNOW IKNOW IKNOW!!!** make it a Karaoke Machine! You know, uhyea Boyfriends likes to Rap. you know that, see the contract details. here, `Boyfriend` is the *best rapper you can ever find*. So.. make sense right, if we blend this in for bf.

Grevor: ah yess! Neshim, you have karaoke protype app here right?

Neshim M'neer: Ah yess. but wait. we did not further developed this software after the jam we did.

Grevor: that's alright! that state is already worth it. you just add AI, that's all!

Neshim: okeh... done, I add AI. and.. Hookx is with me right here. okay, (press `F5` to build and test injecting to target device).... I don't think this gonna work isn't it?

Grevor: (saw it works, did not crash) Neshim, look.

Neshim: okay, is it `Null Reference Cyan access denied` again (witnessed that indeed it doesn't crash).. Whoa oh! Oh my God, no pecking way.

Gyouter: (speechless face)

Grevor: (pogchamp face)... okayh, try.. pressing the dpad?

Neshim: dpad, oh yeah.. debugger mode on, manual direction override.. (pressing direction randomly)... Oh wow! Unbelievable, it still not crash. but uh wait (press and hold down)... Oh God (it is black screen but the Hookx logo still appear), nooo...

Gyouter: (disappointed facepalm again). sigh

Neshim: This is not good. this can jeopardize our universe if we busted. we are not allowed to let anyone know this referece. uh, error message... `Cannot access Cyan`, oh, hold on... (attempting to change Cyan into alternative Cyan)... compile.... (crashed `Null reference Bf cyan color, not allowed`) uh nope. forcing access denied or changing it crashes it, it seems that it is not allowed, it must be this.

Gyouter: Alright, there's nothing we can do. At least it works. and at least there's no word mentioned over it especially by explicit amount.

Neshim: Yeah, so.. (leave Cyan).. (`F5`)... (works again), yeah.

Gyouter: okay. with that out of the mind. let's go. Deploy!
