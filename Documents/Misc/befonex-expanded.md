Dasandim government has been accused of LGBTphobic based masacre after those LGBT people were killed in a natural disaster. The plaintiff accuse the administrative (user account, marriage registers, etc.) tool were a contribution in this mass killing.

Defendant insist that they have nothing to do in the masacre. And they do not tell God to do the Sodom & Gomora style punishment or at least do not encourage any hates against people, as Dasandim strives to restraightens any bends in sexuality before too late. Defendant is under oath and they said the truth.

The court gets more burning as Dasandim is a LGBTphobic planet. Added worse with those Twitter like harrassers lobbying the judges to favour the Plaintiff.

## Summary

- Gaffedu sues Dasandim, accusing using account tool to contribute the mass killing. while it's not, it's just disaster.
- ~~Judge somehow favours Plaintiff & Dasandim lost. Judge thinks LGBTphobic is always full hatred against LGBT, instead of somekind of dislike spectrum.~~
- Judge thank God-ly favours Defendant, so Dasandim wins. Judge thinks that what Dasandim strive make sense & is not what to be considered eugenic whatsoever.
- Gaffedu planet disagree & then declare ~~physical~~ cyber war. They will harrass all Dasandimians to death & will send physical hitmen to every Dasandimians house to kill them.
- Wakturia employees & other Dasandimians come and beg to Gyouter Embinosa (Wakturia leader / Timeline Guard leader) to help save Dasandimians
- Gyouter thought to leave entire planet from Sloantim cluster.
- Jack Gabosh disagree, because there is sibling planet (including Chronos / Sand Timer planer from A Hat in Time). Dan Gabosh continues explains that they would be shot dead.
