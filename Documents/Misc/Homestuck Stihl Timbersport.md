# Stihl Timbersport Kanaya vs. Makima

Family guy inspired cutaway

Homestuck & Chainsaw Man I collab them together.

This not ad, this is a joke. Unless if Stihl decided approve so (yes this is ad), cool and good.

## Begin

Info: Stock Saw. In saw running start. Hands on timber. Start then cut from top, then below that's it, max within 10 cm. Thinnest full cut and fastest wins.

Max Damros Enfield: Ladies, warm your chainsaw.

Kanaya Maryam: (async) (pull start Stihl Stock Saw)!! (Accelerate)... ... ...

Makima (Chainsaw Man): (async) (pull start Pochita)!! (Accelerate)... ... ...

Max: (async 2) Done, leave running, put chainsaw on slot. Hands on timber. 

Kanaya: (async 2) .... (put on slot), ... (hands on timber)

Makima: (async 2) .... (sitt Pochita on slot), ... (hands on timber)

Pochita: (async 2) 😆... 😃.... (being place to the slot) 😆...

Max: (async 3) Get ready, 3, 2, 1, GO!

Kanaya: (async 3) .... (re-equip saw), (saw from top as edge as possible)!!!!!!, (saw from below as edge as possible)!!!!!.

Makima: (async 3) ..... (re-equip Pochita), (saw from top as edge as possible)!!!, (saw from below as edge as possible)!!!.

*audience*: 👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏

Max: Makima, 9.25 second. Kanaya 9.51 second.

Makima: YESS!!!

Max: New, world record! Women Stock Saw. Congratulations, Makima.
