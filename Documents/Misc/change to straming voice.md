# Change to Streaming with voice

## begin
Ahei Dasandimian. Welcome back to another streaming video. Today we are playing `GAME_NAME`. That's right. We got new games here to cover for times to come. Feel free to suggest more.

You notice now that I unmuted mic on Paid Adventure games like this. Okay hear me out. I gotta make some changes here. Let's have some respect. 

Previously I let all gamers be spoiled for these costly of games. You only saw what you saw, people buy games, since physical era to digital we are right now. You didn't see me side, boy, girl. We had difficulties. Not all gamers in my area have digital money, heck not to mentiom their parents allow them so, because of certain.. traumas  handing over credit card informations something2. Guess what me little did back then? That's correct, sparsdat!

Oh, I really wish I could get out from here, becoming normal person that legitly buys game directly officially. How does it feels like? Not much, at all. And I still have to see other gamers, who got no time, lost their money and everything for college already. That's why I got to make voiceless streaming, so less annoyance from my.. handsome, not so sexy and horrid voice of me. Unless they're yeah you know.

Here's the deal. How aboutbwhen in game I talk, and when cutscene, I shut? Guess what, I believe no matter what you are even with abnormalities can focus just the game, how did I do that, and not all would be interested with that, need some not something2. And if you just care the cutscenes, there you go.

That's it. Free Non high spec & not adventure ones will still have all talks even cutscene, you must play the game, you can download this. This just changes the paid adventures and high spec games.
