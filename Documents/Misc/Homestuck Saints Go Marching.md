# Test the Studio

Today we are testing the studio here in Dasandim Studio City. We have a brand new White Room, that's what it simply called.  
Basically, this is fully white room, and you can augment a scene. every scene, you know, the entire floor, wall, & ceiling are basically a display. Like Disney's technic using LED display, this here, is even tinier LED, so small, indiscernable. Prototype, may improve later.  
So yeah here the studio.

Damn, the AO3 queuelines is super long! Of course, lots of creative minds who likes each of every franchises.

Family Guy inspired moment
