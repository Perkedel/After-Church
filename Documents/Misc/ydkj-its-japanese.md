## Round 1

### 1 One. CPU Tag Racing.

Joel: Let's begin with, (category). You got CPUs? I had these.

> Which Clan of E-sport industry that didn't focus on the lap tower until so recently?

Joel: Is it...

- Croffle **Blues**. No, that's Intel, you already know they're PC guys
- Haze **Reds**. No.. no, that's AMD! Also PC guys
- Nomad **Greens** (answer). ARM or Accorn, is a type of RISC architecture formerly on a a computer now is popular on embedded devices like Smartphone, hence it's `Nomad` name, it doesn't stays, it goes with the user.
- Rebellion **Grays**. Yes, the RISC-V. ... No, they started researching on a desktop which technically a Lap Tower, a single board computer to be specific.

Joel: Hey if you haven't heard why did ARM is Green is because they have been green. coincidentally, Nvidia acquired them, which also is Green. Now what, will we get Nvidia RTX on every smartphone? I wish so, you do too?

### 2 Two. Limb weapons

Joel: Next, (category). Hey I just done a research for our lore here in this Perkedel Cinematic Universe. You know, sometimes you'll get whatever emotional state that you would get. There's happy, sad, anger, whatever, like rainbows, not to be confused, the original rainbows. You know what *color* did I got? Sadness!! Oh yeah, what a coincidence. Pixar's sadness is blue, Eifel's Blue is Blue, wait no, that's not, and then this, the Zetrix. Yeah, it's long story. The YouTube channel is Glitch Production so go check them out, it's a big deal. Also I have been scolded by my mother because I did bought their comics for 30 Earth Merican Dollars including shippings, Crazy right? I've had imported items from America or still Australia now, She does not like that expensive spending despite it's all still in my hard earned cash, yeah you know. Okay,

> Tell me. Which Limb weapons originated from Perkedel Technologies

Joel: is it...

- Head. Oh, you mean A Hat in Time? Unfortunately that wasn't my idea.

- Arm (sponsor). Ugh, you picked that Australian figures again, don't you? (sponsor)
- Leg. Uhhh Okay, Unfortunately I cannot find any foot kink other than once a parody from Warner Bros' Teen Titans Go, yeah you see that yourselves.

Joel: Ahhh proud to be us. Seriously, I've seen alot of games which weapons obviously on limbs, guns too boring so they come up with whatever limbs to be weaponized. Gears for Breakfast got head for A Hat in Time, oh Puella is here btw, Oh Hi!, and so on. Well, She's a descent from Chronos planet, far there.

(Sponsor Skipped)!

Joel: (sponsor) Coz that, you just picked this **Smuggled container of recalled cybernetic arms** taken from Glitch Production's Meta Runner verse from Tulah's Tokopedia Store! (wait whistle!) the firmware on all of those have been deleted btw, so figure out how to work it again though. This Incorrect Lootboxes grants you 4000 Kivrontz, Cool and good!

Joel: What? You thought Hokben is a Japanese just because of their Japanese bento style of foods? You wrong, don't be deceived by their serving, they are Indonesian, Look it up! Also you still thought Rexus from China again just because of their cheap and non-special line of peripherals, Okay Uh, I admit, it's hard to not to be here. But it's the fact, Rexus is Indonesian too, so does Advan, GMC, ehh idk. Point is, there are alot of companies that sells this that makes you think it was coming from other else, but turns out it's close by your house, you see that? And hey, did you know, my uncle, Om Markus works at Polytron right now? that's right, he's a researcher there. So if you have Polytron products, parts of the research was my uncle's contribution, cool right?

- Contract thieve. Shoko.
- Monarch. Finn was a butterfly.
- Dark side soldier (answer). That's not the same Finn we're talking about, and yeah he was named `Finn` by Dameron Poe while escaping, because `FN` something something number is hard to memorize.

Joel: Jesus Christ!, On that Adventure Time verse, How many the Finn got reincarnated?! What the peck?! Okay, I'm outta here, he possesses so many, I lost count. Now, which incarnate you'd like pick? I chose Shoko, you? can be multiple. .. Okeh.

### 8 Eight. Everything is Arrestable Under the Law.

Joel: Look at this. (category).

> Say Sherlock Holmes has been caught by law enforcement. in the trial, what convict would he get for his detectivity?

Joel: is it...

- Violation of Privacy Laws (answer). Sherlock Holmes in his activity of detective, often detect and reveals secret out of his deduction skill and stuffs he scanned throughout, in which if any of the evidence got leaked OR by any mean for such egregious privacy rights that even protects the evil ones, would cause this arrestable violation offense that will be linked to any chapter related to privacy laws available in the region or anywhere where the parent rules in effect, disregarding it exist or not btw.
- Violation of Property Rights. I mean, yeah he may trespass something, but not for no reason of course only if he solved the crime.
- Violation of Reputation laws. You kidding me? Those goons are evil! Unless you are in Japan, goons that are proven guilty, is guilty. Great, speaking about Japan exposing this little fact from Paolo's (https://youtu.be/hG28fQE_2A8 I think) video would get me canceled, idk.
- none. Well, you may think a hero would be forgiven, but you forgot the fact that it's no longer true to this day. Evil ones in fact, are unfortunately sponsored every law enforcements around this world. We also are actively auditing our own to see if our own ones are also manipulated and fix immediately when found.

### 9 Nine. Billionth of `E`

Joel: Let's math it out with, (category) (read `E` like `E` meme)......

> What does `Kilo E` means?

- 1e+3 (answer). `e` notation means 10 power to whatever number next by `+` sign. so this equals to 1 times 10^3 a.k.a. 1000, One thousand means Kilo. Got it?
- 1e+2.
- 1e+1.
- 1e+0.

Joel: I gotta look up at the internet, it's a fight, what the hell are these weird notations, my life in school & college skipped one of those. Now you should know, I should know too, hopefully.

Barolok: Ahei, it's me, Barolok.

Joel: This surreal primitive is the veteran here. He worked in alot of computer industry back in the early tech uprising. Well, he has too many thoughts, so much that he had difficulty reaching information he wants, times when he wanted so. So tell me, do you have anything today?

Barolok: Yes. I have problem.

Joel: Okay?

Barolok: I was browsing meme repos.

Joel: Hu um.

Barolok: Then I passed this familiar song I used to hear when I was assisting somebody in Japan back then.

Joel: So?

Barolok: I forgot the title. It has `Stay with me` though.

Joel: That's right. I.. gotta remember that too.

Barolok: Can you please help me,

> The song goes `Stay with Me`, `Mayonara`, etc.

Barolok: I think either of these keywords

- Miki Matsubara (answer). Okay, searching... Song Match.
- Sam Smith. Okay, searching.... Same title but song does not match
- Celine Dion. I don't think so.
- Michael Bublé. I don't think so.

Barolok: Got it again. Thancc gamers.

Joel: Okay, so.. he keeps having this. Like me, but much worse. Well, can't be helped, it's the disk speed we gotta upgrade. And damn them, for not releasing the Song match source code, he needs this!

### 12 Twelve. Top Nice Things About Japan.

Joel: Hokey, (category).

> Which Culture that are exclusive to Japan? To this day and too lazy to be applied on everyone else.

- Smartphoneism. Sorry, it's internation, not mention that it was IBM's idea at first.
- Behaviourism (answer). In school, Japanese people are taught to do the chores themselves, be responsible, yadi yada. Then applies to everywhere, like make sure you clean your station before you leave, and most of the time clean entire stadiums after the game, even if you lose.
- Musicalism. Um sorry, [Yamaha Musicsoft](https://shop.usa.yamaha.com) division is European.
- Artism. I know Anime originates from Japanese, but it seems everyone now had adopted it.

Joel: I'm really impressive, they have that kinda behaviour which I wish we all so do. But yeah, we are lazy, too lazy to standup just to dispose junk even the bin is 15 centimeter away. idk, how do we supposed to get started?

Now it's up to you people to figure out, it gotta be simple.

## Removed Questions

### 10 Ten. Indonesia has already independent since 1945.

Joel: is it..

- Sesingkat (answer). Correct, it's `Sesingkat-singkatnya` as in (old Indonesian) `dalam tempoh jang Sesingkat-singkatnja`, which basically means `As soon as possible`. Yeah, colonizers have to hand it over now.
