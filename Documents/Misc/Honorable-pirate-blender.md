# Honorable Pirate for Blender models

cutaway for Family guy inspired sitcom

## Pre-cutaway sample

A: For real this time. It's just like having to become modern day cyber Robin Hood, isn't it?

## Begin

### Penetiary / Prison

Jade Knox (prison guard, female): move! (async) (hit)

Jeff Moore: (async) ugh!! (get inside cell)

Jade: (close door slide in), (lock cell)!

Bastangor Uchakaka: (menacingly block way) Hey, welcome. What do you in for?

Jeff: I made a software to scam people.

Bastangor: (underestimate) Oh cool! How does it work?

Jeff: When the people fell for it, their files got uploaded. 

Bastangor: (bored & more underestimate) Okay..

Jeff: I only set it to upload `Blend` files though..

Bastangor: (becomes honorly fearful towards Jeff & step back no more menacing; private blender files from artist notorious for not sharing are highly sought after)!?!?!?, Oh, okay.. how many victims?..

Jeff: 600s. all publicly shared to everyone.

Bastangor: (even more fearful, confirmed that's the pirate everyone talking about)!..... Guys..

Jeff: I have other friends still active to help me, so it could be thousands now.

*everyone*: (also fearful honorly)!..

Trudakor Uchakaka: (escort calling Jeff, treat Jeff like a king) Master, your assistant would like to speak with you.

## Extra theory

- Jeff never shows face nor name when doing this. Public only knows his actions & result
- Everyone in this cell group is talking about him
- Everyone knows Jeff had deadly power that he can use anytime for those who refuse to help him. He also has another power that control people's mind to get it of from their will.
- But everyone is very honored by that pirate, & felt lucky to meet him in person, at last.
