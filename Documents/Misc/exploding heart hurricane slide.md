# Exploding heart hurricane slide

Cutaway FamilybGuy Inspired.

A family of 4 (mom, dad, oldest girl, youngest boy) rides tumble slide (slide that drops high into the bigger fallen funnel slide, swing fast, when momentum out, you go out at the other funnel end). But one boy has an explosive heart.

Use Taman Mini's Snowbay as the reference
