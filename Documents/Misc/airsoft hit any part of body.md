# Airsoft hit any part of body

Cutaway family guy inspired

## pre-cutaway

A: Rule is if you got hit, just anywhere part of body, you're `dead`. `hit`. Mark this with raising hand while getting back to spawn area.

B: Any, anywhere?

A: Yeah. Coz no telling unlike airsoft, so whatever hit, you `died`.

B: Huh, that's no fair. That mean if ones get over extension, it if `hit` does constitutes also then?

## begin

Yorte Sebian (male): (aim sniping)... (found a homestuck style troll hiding but her left horn did not conceal)??, (aim to the horn), (charge bolt), (fire).

bullet: (flies)!!!!!!!.... (hit Carla's left horn)!

Carla Sabji Ziem (female, lightning bolt shapped horn): (`hit`) Dead (Raise hand)!

Yorte: (whisper) yesshhh..

## post-cutaway

A: What do you talking about?

B: Players that got (demonstrate head) horns, (butt) tails, 

A: Unfortunately that still hits. I.. don't know. No telling, so uhhh..

B: Oh well, that's gotta be hard.
