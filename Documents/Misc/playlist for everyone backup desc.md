# wHOAHAT?!??!
Odysee finally has playlist!!! no pecking way!!! yess!!!!

# Also is decentralized publication
publishing playlist is also considered uploading to LBRY network. Same, you deposit for it that.

# Which means you won't get strike!!!..
I think.. but, at least it way 999999999999999999999999 times more lenient than YouTube, where now you can get strike just because you have 69420 video saved to it. Doesn't make sense! the uploader supposed to be blamed, not viewers, duh!

# let's push to the limit
how many videos can you save here.

# Obviously though
We cannot put fully 69420 videos in here, not even if there's a reverse bait about it!

For that, there is another playlist dedicated just for that. And for safety reason, we won't provide the link in here but of course, it's always available under our Perkedel channel yeah! Well, it is only visible through [LBRY Desktop App](http://lbry.com/get ) OR [these clients]( ) of course.

wait. Is regular LBRY has Playlist feature? purple tagged playlist cannot appear in Odysee. Design intention. I wish there is LBRY Hub some sort of. I cannot take this easily, so please let us know if you have DecentralizedHub LBRY.
OH IT DOES!!! Yes, the 69420 playlist is available right now!

# Somehow the description data has been corrupted
either this Odysee client issue or something we can't figure out. We got so many video, is that the cause? no?
