Gonock Tubu: Jesus Christ. I don't want to hear anymore unusual reproduction sh88 nonna gain. Pls, I'm gonna puke.

Slith Throne: Well that's just the beginning. Take a look at Sky's mom.

## Begin

### Empty Flame Field, Hell / Jahanam / Neraka

Lucifer: Okay guys here we are.

(Rotten wood hard fleshes piled up)

Info: Yes, it's a girl. Big shout out to Lukas Piskor / vanripper.

Lucifer: (get up to the pile).. ..  .., Joe, watch! 

Joe Lubu: huh?

Lucifer: (Take out swiss army knife), (expose left arm fisted face up), (scratch fore arm with that knife to start flame)!!!!...

(Hot flake of her fore arm fell to the meat)

..

(Flame start, flame instantly engulf flame)

Joe: HOAAAAA!!!, HOAAA!!!, I AM ON FIRE!!!, AAAAAAAAA!!!!!!

*every other demon & Lucy*: (awkward wtf face)???.....

Lucifer: (get down & approach)!

Joe: HELP!!! I AM GONNA DIE!!! (Remember to drop & roll)!!! !!! !!!... .... (realised nobody help), (stand up) why don't you h.. oh yeah I am ded and fall to hell, BUT IT'S F8888 HOT!!! OH MY F88888 GOOOOD!!

Lucifer: (sigh) ugh..., (take extinguisher), (extinguish Joe)!!!!

Joe: Ahhhhh

Lucifer: Now. We are going to wait 30 minutes, no Earth 30 minutes. And the babies should be ready.

Fook: Okay.

Lucifer: (walk to beach relax chair) meanwhile, I'm gonna rest. (Sitt on chair), (listen to music).

(40 minutes later)

Lucifer: (still asleep).... (awake slowly).. (Fook is asleep on job too)?!? (Walk to Fook), (slap)!!!

Fook: (suprised wake up) HEUH!!

Lucifer: Hey wake up! The babies ready!

Fook: (quickly prepare to harvest) Yes ma'am..

(Harvested baby 1. Yolaine)

Fook: Okay, that's it? Is there other?

Lucifer: Is there other? Ah yeah because I intentionally put only 1 that's it. How do you feel when you're alone, and nobody care?

(Zoom out to overal scene & back again)

Fook: ... I don't think that dry question a good idea today. Perhaps a good idea to make another.

Lucifer: No no, get out. I just need 1. We'll see if just one is enough to rule over the humanity, heheheheee!!!

Fook: Okay. Just so you know, humans are getting aware faster these days. 

Lucifer: But not sexuality desire (look at baby face). Trust me. There will be 1 to rule the all.

Fook: Also, Obul. That priest we gotta take care of. ... ... Just don't forget about the **chip**.

Lucifer: relax! Humans will eventually make those. The SIGN won't go anywhere.

Fook: ugh.. (portal & leave)!

Lucifer: ..., (look back to baby). Hello, slave. No no. (Fist cover mouth) Ahem.., Hello, daugther, Argh, by my Father! Why is that so hard to say?!, stupid human, cannot make female offspring wording the easier ones and **LEFT** male ones `son`?!?! Why not `don`, or `fon`, `zon` no wait that's similar, ... `lin`???? 

(Camera zoom to overal & back)

Lucifer: ... ... Eh whatever. (Look baby) You, Yes you! I want you to marry a man somewhere. Has to be human. (Find where planet to deploy later) My Dad can't get this easy no more. If He can, I can! Ugh! ... (found one) Oh yess! This planet. Yess!! Molvedin. The first Christian to ever live another Planet, yeeeesssss. Okay. Cool. But first I'm gonna.. take care of you, that's a thing. And then you're free to go. And... you *know what to do*. Hmm, I think I forgot something. (Pinch back neck to connect one last nerve that emulates realistic human behaviour)!!

Yolaine: (realization)!?!?! (Cry)!!!!!!

Lucifer: Ah... perfect. My little lump of misery. (Hug & tap pat back) shh shh shh shh.... (portal and leave)!!

Joe: (awake fast) HEU HEUH HEUHU!! Heuh.. (panik stand up & look around)?! ?! (Lucifer left him again) ARGH, F888888 great. You know I already know the path, b8888!! (Sigh)!!!... Stupid hagwhore, never give me teleport sh88..

Info: Joe is human rejected to go to Heaven because of a behaviour God does not like. You guessed it. Blasphemed to Holy Spirit, multiple times, and no apology to his demise.

## post-cutaway

Gonock: Okay, not that bad. I mean..

Slith: Yeah, if she made it, that's happened.

Gonock: Okay.. btw, just asking. Latsufir is half angel isn't he? Sky half demon. Coz mama Bilo is angel, mama Yolaine is that demon.

Slith: Yes.

Gonock: (got it but fear talking about this would destroy their potential ship & marriage because of ½ demon and ½ angel marriage controvercy).. Okay moving on. So, what do we do next?

Info: People, don't worry. Even if one day there was Twitter drama about half demon x half angel marriage, every counter terrorists will reply about Obul and how extremistly bad his behaviour is during his life as a priest and how many all he talks is just killing demon stuff like that. Those terrorist on Twitter are once again cringe, people!
