# Briefing
Johan Carl:  
Good Afternoon, 47. Your destination is High Tower in Dubai, UAE. You will eliminate 3 targets.

**Pasten Young**, also known as Dragon Slayer, infamous for being harsh critics of various reality shows. Notable for recent action of criticism against a virtual idol, The Dragon Idol, hence his nickname, Dragon Slayer. He simply noticed for the statistic of viewers that shows a country being the most top, which is his *competitor nation*, and declared war against The Dragon Idol, and caused our client, VirtualLive Productions suspended the idol for reason undisclosed.

**Reso Tan**, a.k.a Bunny Hunter, infamous for setting up pranks and traps for innocent people and have caught over 100 victims as of his career. One of which is a virtual idol, The Bunny Idol, hence his nickname. He set up traps by building collections of memes and happened, that the Bunny Idol reviewed it. Words that build by her, causes sparks by some but resulted in a forest fire.

**Kaung Pao**, a.k.a. Twin Berserker, infamous for capturing innocent spiritual beings, and without mercy used them for his experiments. Recently made his unusual catch, a virtual idol, The Twin Surreal Idol, hence his nickname. He saw that the idol showed up the statistic of viewers and happened like the Dragon Idol's, shows the top country as the separate own. Hence he sponsored our client to suspend the idol as well as sponsored a game company MunaMushita inc. to disallow all VirtualLive Productions members to stream their game.
