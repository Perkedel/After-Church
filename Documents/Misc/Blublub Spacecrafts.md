# Blublub Spacecraft

Spacecraft manufacturer in Blublub system planet. Famous for making various scout spaceships which are compact and agile.

Their notable design, Blublub 635 printed & assembled by many people across galaxies.

Their philosophy being Open Source contributes to such popularity. Since Blubblub is far far away & unstrategic with few neighbouring civilizations on systems as well as exporting being too expensive, they broadcasted the design to many galaxies down to its screws and glue designs. This allows their spaceship to be known and be usefulnfor everyone. Additionally, makers are allowed to edit & share the edit. They wish that edits are also open source. This is classifiable as CC4.0-BY-SA.

Fun fact, Dasandimian's Saucer are inspired from Blublub's design & have similar guts with the original 635.
