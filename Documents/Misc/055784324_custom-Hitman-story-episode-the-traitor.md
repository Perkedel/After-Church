# The Traitor
## Location
Sapienza
## Mission
- Eliminate Yodi Savalaz
	- Any Method
	- Any Disguise
- Hack 3 betrayed websites
	- 3 websites: Online Store, Video hosting, Lewd TV streaming

## Briefing
Johan Carl: Good Afternoon, 47. your target is Yodi Savalaz. currently is CEO of **Sack32 inc.**, was previously a CEO of 2 companies: **EasyShop** and **PeopleTube**. He has put these 3 companies into severe damage, by putting restrictions by restrictions as he joined the company. recently, an uproar from netizen arises against **Sack32** where Yodi revised the rule that make it requires all user to be verified in order to upload their videos, claiming to keep **Sack32** safe and sound from online predators, said Yodi in last month interview.

Yodi will be on Sapienza for a celebration which topics are undisclosed to the public. My worry is that he will join another company to put another damage to such company. Eliminate the target, and once you done, you need to restore 3 website he has brought the damage into, are the following:

- EasyShop
- PeopleTube
- and Sack32

His laptop, containing the access for those website admin, will be on his hotel room. keep in mind though, that there are more guards added inside and outside for that reason.

### Mission Active
and as always, great luck, 47.

# Play
## Start
Johan: Welcome to Sapienza, 47. in the scene I can see that the stage for the celebration is now close to ready. I also detected that the target is around the back stage. If not, he could be at a restaurant nearby.

## Saw the target
Johan: That's him. Yodi Savalaz, your target. What a traitor, isn't he.

## Story, The Betrayal of Sack32
Komyo (Backstage worker): To be honest, I think what Yodi did on Sack32 disappoints us. I now no longer care if such rule makes children happy, but at the same time, it kills all communities.

Gendez (Backstage worker): yeah, I know. I rather resign sooner.

Komyo: do you have any idea what behind of verification requirements?

Gendez: I believe everything has been purely a sponsor from a space bandit organization. idk, maybe it's just money run.

Komyo: No, I don't think this one is about money. I cannot sense between this and that, if this is worth anything. You see, *Premium subscriber* goes down drastically at the time this rule has established.

Gendez: then for sure it's a space bandit.

Komyo: probably. we should find opportunity to exit from this f8888 hell.

### MISSION STORY REVEALED: The Betrayal of Sack32
Johan: hmmm, space bandit. I believe they are talking about Kamatussa. the notorious psycopath that destroy lewd tribes. interesting. hard to believe that Kamatussa worked with the thing he purely hates, but make sense. he is there only to bring desstruction to those. good point.

## Eliminated Yodi Savalaz
Johan: Target down. Now reach his laptop. I'll give you where his room at

Intel info: Room 342

Reward Popup: **BODY HIDDEN +500**

Johan: Remember, 47. there are more guards even inside the room too. be careful.

## Encounter Yodi's laptop
Johan: Whew. so simple that guards is not on the window too. Laptop is there, go and open it up!

Laptop: Fingerprint please

Johan: Oh no, the laptop is locked. I think you need to copy his fingerprint. Now go back to the corpse and use your camera to save the fingerprint. usually it's his right thumb, left thumb, and left index.

## Go back to target to steal fingerprint
Johan: right. Now take fingerprint.

Fingerprint of all fingers: (already destroyed into smooth flat surface as his death)

Johan: What the?! damn. we didn't expect this one. He's ain't a human. very clever. right, don't worry. there has to be another way. but just in case, just take the picture of those 3 fingers I mentioned. Then connect to the laptop. We'll try inject the fingerprint scan simulation, or have us hijack through.

## Go back to Yodi's room again.
Johan: Let's see. connect and inject the scan simulation of those image.

47: (connect laptop), (open up images view), (inject this image to fingerprint scan emulator).

Laptop: Error! not match.

Johan: right, that mean it's destroyed really. right, buy us sometime to prevent guards coming. we'll be quick. (mute mic), **Sudo**, now!

Sudo Harvester: alrighty then! (hack laptop remotely)

47: (watches around)

Rendo (agile guard): (just climbed to Yodi's window like 47 did) Yodi? where are you?

47: (subdue that guard)!

Rendo: offf fckkck pls somebodi... (syncope)!

Johan: didn't expect that. 47, you better kill that guy this time. We detected and recognized that this guy is Kamatussa's baby tube. there is no snap neck alarm installed here.

47: (snap neck and hide body)! (close window and curtain)

## Laptop hacked
Sudo: we got it! we're in. right, now to the restoration.

Johan: great! 47, keep the lookout.

Sudo: okay it's done! now the second.

Pailing (versatile gunner guard): (entered Yodi room without knocking to bring condiments).

Johan: what?! another Kamatussa baby tube?! kill that!

47: (shoot the guard with Silenced Silverballer)! (hide body). (put do not distub tag on the door front), (close and lock door)

Johan: okay, the wardrobe is now full. I hope this measure helps.

Sudo: Second done, now the third. now this one is easy. give me a sec.

Johan: I have an idea, 47. you should go out through normally instead. I wonder if there's another Kamatussa baby tube. as always, don't let yourself be seen at all today. even if we got it a real human.

Sudo: WE'RE DONE!!! ALL 3 WEBSITE FIXED!

Johan: alright, 47, we're done! quick, get out from here. and also kill Kamatussa baby tube. we'll tell you if it is. GO!

47: (disconnect camera and go out)

## New Mission: Kill all Kamatussa's baby tubes

- Johan: This one.
- Johan: aaand, that!

### detected human
- Johan: nope!
- Johan: not this one.
