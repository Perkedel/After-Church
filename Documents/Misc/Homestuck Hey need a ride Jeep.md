# Hey, need a ride?

Family guy inspired moment

Summary, because not all gamer speak Bahasa Indonesia:

- Hoxs wanted to rent Jeep tour package.
- Tavros happen to the there, saw Hoxs, one of the Dasandimian
- Vriska notices that Jeep is not a Jeep, it's actually Suzuki Jimny. So she telepathically tell Tavros to offer Hoxs and family to ride Tavros' Real Jeep instead
- Hoxs accept, bring wife & 2 daughters. Confused what about thay guy, tell Andy to cancel.
- Andy just came out with EDC. And at an instant he saw Tavros had bigger and luxurious Jeep, he flabbergasted and emotion turns sour, because that car is much better than his. Cry, ask God to provide emotional strength after this emotional and mental damage.
- Tavros appalled with Vriska's action for doing her mischied again, Vriska shrugs with menacing smile as she has been satisfied, but at the same time seen that it's not the real Jeep, and that tour costs IDR 200K, which is very expensive considering that it's not the real Jeep.
- Hoxs realizes, he and his entire family almost got scammed thinking he would ride Jeep, but indeed is a knock off. He thanked Tavros & Vriska for saving him from scam. He just figured as Tavros reviewed this action, that it was Vriska's idea.
- Later down the road, the rain comes while the roof and the door modules are at home but thankfully the Jeep has emergency tarp which is used right now as it rained. Hoxs thought God is upset since they broke that poor Andy's heart. Tavros however does not believe it that way, confused, and could be any other factor, since this mount are notorius for raining very often.
- next month, Andy finally able to credit buy that Rubicon Jeep Hybrid. Since getting this is very expensive, he put the cost for same route for IDR 2 Million, to hopefully help recoup this huge debt. He uses Citibank Credit card to do this, just so he would not be reshuned last time. Andy is now the only and first tour that has this Jeep, and would be viral.
- Pulo Sewu brought his siblings to tour with that Jeep.
- Andy about to upset as he encountered candy horned human (it's not, it's Troll, it's Alternian).
- Pulo state that he and his siblings / dancendants are not Tavros.
- Andy retold that he was upset because of Tavros incident last month.
- Pulo relieved Andy and paid that 2 Million through main digital payment interface in Indonesia, QRIS. You scan QR code given by merchant with your digital bank app.
- Lawang Sewu shout to all sibling to ride now as transaction is complete & ready to start tour. Yes, idk, *Thousand Doors*, Correct, a defunt dutch era train station from Semarang. Now a museum, okay I digress.
