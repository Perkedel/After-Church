## About Rivven & Garren prisoned
You know, resurrections cost alot of energy. As you can see above the process looks simple but it's difficult, especially at negotiation. God is the One that decides whether living lives, dead, relives again. The resurrection procedure here repeatedly spams God infinite times until the energy runs out, all the time until God says `Fine, here's your human` stuff like that. every attempt of negotiation consumes about 1 million Joules minimum, which can goes up to around 7 sextillion.

Now, since this resurrection was caused by a criminal who causes the victim to die, then criminal must pay the fine to recoup the cost of this resurrection process, as well as other things. How does it looks like, you may ask?

## Extraction room, Judgemental dimension
(light on)!

Rivven: eough... ummmv

Garren: (awake too)..

Bormir: (looked at those 2 in spreading lock ward bed)... Okay, let's start.

Kurgor: (press start energy extraction)!

Rivven: OAAAAAA!!!!

Garren: HUUUUUUUUGH!!!

## Cell room, 20 minutes later.
Hoglev: (trolley Rivven & Garren back into their cell)... (open cell), (push the hook trolley into the cell), (release chain), (clear up chain hooks), (take off strain from Rivven & Garren), (put back strain equipment into the trolley storage), (pull trolley out of cell), (close & lock cell), (leave scene bringing the trolley out too).

## Yep
They'll be tired everyday, taking whole 16 decades to recover. Oh wait, & another 16 decade again before the release.
