Hello, this is Meme man. I demand to bestow you all new information. Lastly, JOELwindows7 was on search of a COOL and GOOD voice I am having. He had searched from Google, "Meme man Voice". Here is the result.
from what he got, is a reddit page, for which a user had been asked long ago. axolotl_meme, in 2017, September, asked.
finally, a month later, in October, MEMEZONEMLG, answered: "www.text2speech.org", text, number two, speech, dot org. that is a website that uses Festival Voice system, in "http://www.festvox.org/flite/". the about page of text2speech says so.
