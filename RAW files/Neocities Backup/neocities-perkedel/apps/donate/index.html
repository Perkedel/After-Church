    <h1>Donation</h1>
      <p>Perkedel Technologies always provides you gamers, software all (tools & games) for $0, & hardware with appropriately priced as affordable as possible.<br>
      Unfortunately, life these days is costly, and we fear one day breathing (Oxygen, e.g.) would also becomes subscription either through pollution or various ways of egregious greeds.<br>
      That's why, we need money. I mean, we want money!! Not only needed but also to buy stuffs. stuffs that helps us create cool things (prioritizing hardwares of course, and some games, less tools).<br>
      It would be helpful, for those of you who had parent's revenue at your disposal to spend for me rather than uselessly scalping lots of sport cars for yourselves e.g.<br>
      See, since when the last time you opened garage for that car your great inf parent left over there covered with billions of dust bunnies?<br>
      I know, I would hoard alot too just like you gamers,<br> 
      but is your case helps billions of people cope for the data losses & downtook download links?<br>
      I mean, <b>USEFUL UTILITIES & GAMES SOURCE CODES!!!</b> yess. Man, almost there.<br>
      So please, I want & need money. thancc cool and good
      </p>
