      <p>While this particular website itself (from the HTML to the JavaScript we programmed) does not collect any information whatsoever (since we don't program login here), some assets like embedded video & games hosted on 3rd party, plugins, or maybe-or-less Neocities this site was hosted by, <b>may collect informations</b> whenever accessed such as but not limited to:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>IP Addresses</li>

      <p>We have to warn you, some websites are plain nasty. And we all know, in case you'd wanted the information to be deleted, it's gonna be a hell. Not only you have to contact & ask, often times, they may not favour your request so much after all. Hmmm, perhaps use <a class="Buttonnize" href="https://www.saymine.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">SayMine</a>? idk..</p>

      idk, anywhere.. Sorry we don't have business contact address at the moment, nor department that handles privacy concerns. Maybe just go to Joel's cointree & get in touch <b>through mentions so everybody curious & know</b>.
