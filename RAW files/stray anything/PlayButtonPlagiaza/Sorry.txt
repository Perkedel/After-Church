my adobe account, the photoshop trial is expired.
if create another account, it will confuse everything.

I try find craxk, but all of them no matter torrent or what is detected as virus by WIndows 10 Antivirus.
that's the Security built in on latest Windows 10! October update.
Even can delete that file on Sandboxie temp folders!

no time to setup VM

then, I can only Krita. and Inkscape.
both are stable version
in Krita, we missing the Linear Inner glow! only radial
We don't have 5-spoke star brush, but 4 spoke star brush
our lens flare screen is 4 spoke star brush

.kra file is the krita file
.psd is the krita file convert to PSD. might be bad
.svg is the Inkscape file.

we built the button on krita and pasted it to Inkscape.

Feel how suffering homeworks. not regarding whether when I was high school,
but the type of this work that talks about copying what requested.

sorry if I sounds rejecting.
I am pro for Original drawing, not plagiazing.
hence why Perkedel has no "100% exact copy" commision type.

I understand if I have to plagiaze, e.g. they are not free, not available on our platform, etc.
I won't be perfect. just terrible, terrible in similarity.

but decent in quality.
metaphorically, Blender is terrible and Maya is great. terrible because Blender is not similar.
but Blender is actually high quality! higher than Maya! Blender deserves!

oops! I forgot! the original is linear center whitened play now!!! I radial it.

fool photoshop! cannot permanent buy! subscription only!
do not buy affinity!!!
